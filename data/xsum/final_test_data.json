    "document": "Many of them made headlines - from banning all Muslims entering the US, to building a wall along the border with Mexico.\nBut as he and his White House team approach the 100-day mark of his presidency, it is clear he has shifted his stance on a number of key issues.\nBefore: As a candidate, Mr Trump derided climate change as a hoax concocted by China, and the regulations of Paris as stifling to American growth.\nAfter: After three months of prevarications behind the closed doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the president came down decisively on the side near the exits. Quitting the Paris deal, signed by nearly 200 countries, will take a few years but this is unequivocally a promise kept.\nBefore: One of Mr Trump's trademark rally pledges was to repeal and replace Obamacare - his predecessor's attempt to extend healthcare to the estimated 15% of the country who are not covered.\nIt is widely hated by Republicans, who say the law imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a \"job killer\" and decrying the reforms - officially the Affordable Care Act - as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.\nAfter: Within two days of his election he softened his approach, saying he wanted to keep the \"strongest assets\".\nThen the House Republicans put forward a plan, which the president fully backed, but it was mauled by doctors' groups, hospitals and other parts of the medical industry. The government's own budget office said it would strip insurance from millions of Americans, and its approval rating among the public sank. The Democrats opposed it and several wings of the Republican party were uneasy. It was passed by the House of Representatives but the Senate has said it will rewrite the bill from scratch.\nBefore: His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises.\nMr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it.\nAfter: Mexico maintains it will never pay for it, and even the president has conceded that the US will have to pay up front and then seek reimbursement in some way.\nThe US Congress is exploring funding options for the wall, but many Republicans will be unhappy about footing a bill which could rise to $21.5bn (Â£17.2bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report.\nThat's much higher than Mr Trump's estimated price tag of $12bn (Â£9.6bn).\nThere are also landowners who protest against a \"government land grab\" - and a lawsuit from an environmental group launched in April.\n\"We're building the wall,\" he said in February. \"In fact it's going to start very soon.\"\nBefore: Mr Trump called Nafta \"a disaster\" and warned that the TPP \"is going to be worse, so we will stop it.\"\nAfter: Mr Trump pledged to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He did in his first few days.\nAnd he vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta) and, after threatening to pull out, the White House has said that Canada and the US have agreed to talks.\nBefore: Mr Trump initially promised to ban all Muslims entering the US - a \"total and complete\" shutdown should remain until the US authorities \"can figure out what's going on\".\nBut he switched to \"extreme vetting\" after he became the party's presidential candidate.\nAfter: As president, he has introduced two travel bans, which have both become ensnarled by legal challenges. The second was a slightly watered-down version of the first, but a judge in Hawaii said barring people from six mainly Muslim countries, even temporarily, violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland cited Trump campaign statements as evidence.\nPresident Trump has railed against \"judicial overreach\" and hinted that he may take the case to the Supreme Court, but has said little on the matter in a round of media interviews this week.\nFive questions on the revised travel ban\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are 11.3 million - \"have to go\".\nAfter: As polling day approached, his stance began to soften slightly, then after the election he scaled it back to some two to three million deportations of people who \"are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers\".\nThe Migration Policy Institute, a US-based think tank, has one of the higher figures for illegal immigrants with criminal records, which it puts at 890,000, including people charged with crossing the border illegally.\nThe number of removals peaked in 2012 and has been falling since. It is too early to say if there has been an increase since President Trump's inauguration.\nReality Check: Is deporting of 'bad dudes' at record rate?\nTrump voter's husband faces deportation\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it \"obsolete\". One issue that bugged him was whether members were pulling their weight and \"paying their bills\". In one New York Times interview in July 2016, he even hinted that the US would not come to the aid of a member invaded by Russia.\nAfter: But as he hosted Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House in April, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. \"I said it [Nato] was obsolete,\" Mr Trump said. \"It's no longer obsolete.\"\nBefore: During a speech in Iowa in November 2015, Mr Trump warned that he would, using an expletive, bomb so-called Islamic State into obliteration.\nAfter: The president dropped the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on an IS-stronghold in Afghanistan.\nAt the site of the Mother of All Bombs\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a \"currency manipulator\" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of \"raping\" the US. China has been accused of suppressing the yuan to make its exports more competitive with US goods.\nAfter: He told the Wall Street Journal in April that China had not been \"currency manipulators\" for some time and had actually been trying to prevent the yuan from further weakening.\nBefore: \"I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents.\"\nAfter: He vowed to appoint a conservative justice and he has - Neil Gorsuch. It took a procedural change to Senate rules, but it's a victory nonetheless.\nBefore: Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding \"immediately\" and \"make it also much worse\", adding \"torture works\".\nAfter: But after his inauguration, the president said he would defer to the opposing belief, espoused by Defence Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo.\nMr Pompeo said during his confirmation hearing said he would \"absolutely not\" reinstate such methods.\nBefore: \"Lock her up\" was one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters.\nThey wanted to see Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in prison over the use of her private email server while secretary of state.\nAnd Mr Trump was more than willing to back their calls for, at the very least, a fresh investigation. During the debates, he told Mrs Clinton: \"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\"\nAfter: The president-elect's tone changed almost as soon as he had won, describing the woman he had said was \"such a nasty woman\" as someone the country owed \"a debt of gratitude\". Later, he said he \"hadn't given [the prosecution] a lot of thought\" and had other priorities.\nOn 22 November, Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not pursue a further investigation - to help Mrs Clinton \"heal\".\nBefore: The country's infrastructure \"will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it\", he said in his victory speech in November.\nAfter: Has repeated his vow to spend big on the country's roads, rail and airports, but no sign yet of action.\nBefore: Mr Trump pledged during his campaign to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a divided city which both Israelis and Palestinians claim.\nAfter: He approved a waiver to keep the embassy in place, but suggested in a statement that it would be eventually relocated. \"The question is not if that move happens, but only when,\" the White House said, adding the decision was taken in order to \"maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians\".",

She was given a special juvenile Oscar in 1935, when she was just six years old. To this day, she is still the youngest person to receive an Academy Award.\nWith the nickname \"America's little darling\", she was ranked as Hollywood's biggest draw for four years running from 1935 to '38 in an annual poll of US cinema owners.\nHer rendition of the song On the Good Ship Lollipop in the film Bright Eyes was among her most famous performances.\nSources:  Shirleytemple.com/IMDB\nHer other films included Curly Top, The Littlest Rebel, Baby Take a Bow and Little Miss Marker.\nShe was such a hit that US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt dubbed her \"Little Miss Miracle\" for raising morale during the Great Depression and she was credited with helping save 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy.\nTemple starred in a total of 43 feature films - but found it difficult to sustain her career in adulthood and left acting behind in 1950.\nShe continued to appear on television, but that work dried up and she eventually stepped away from the spotlight.\nWhen she came back into the public eye, it was in a new guise. Under her married name Shirley Temple Black, she ran as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967 but lost.\nRichard Nixon later appointed her as a member of the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly before President Ford named her the US ambassador to Ghana in 1974.\nIn 1989, she was made the US ambassador to Czechoslovakia shortly before the fall of the country's Communist regime.\nShe considered her background in entertainment an asset to her political career. \"Politicians are actors too, don't you think?\" she once said.\nIn a statement announcing her death, her family said: \"We salute her for a life of remarkable achievements as an actor, as a diplomat, and most importantly as our beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and adored wife for 55 years of the late and much missed Charles Alden Black.\"\nActor George Clooney was among those to pay tribute. He said: \"Watching clips of her, it's so amazing that she was such a part of our film history from the very beginning.\n\"I'm sure it wasn't easy being a child star, although she went on to become an ambassador, so she re-invented herself along the way. But it's a great loss. I wish all the best for her family and thank her for her contribution.\"\nActress Whoopi Goldberg wrote on Twitter: \"The Good Ship Lollypop has sailed today with Shirley Temple aboard,\" and described the star as a true one of a kind.\nJoan Rivers tweeted: \"Rest in peace, Shirley Temple Black.

    "document": "When you consider it's been 34 years since Britain has got this far, beating a team as strong as France to reach the semis is a great achievement for everybody involved.\nRoger Federer is one of the best players to ever play the game, and it took him until last year to win the Davis Cup.\nHe might not have played at every opportunity, but he needed Stan Wawrinka to step up his game over the last couple of years to help him get there.\nI think our rise through the different Davis Cup zones has been the quickest by any team but our success has still been built over a few years, and I don't think anyone in the British team has crumbled. Everyone has produced when it matters.\nWe've had great performances from the likes of Dan Evans and James Ward, Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins won a bunch of doubles matches, Dom Inglot didn't get the win in Glasgow but he played a fantastic match against the Bryan brothers.\nI thought Jamie played a great match on Saturday; he did really, really well after I started the doubles a bit slowly.\nHaving got this far, I'd obviously love to go on and win it, but Australia will be extremely difficult in September and everyone has to play their part again. As I say, you can't win this event as a one-man team.\nOne of the great things about the Davis Cup is that when you're struggling, you can call on the crowd to help you out.\nI was definitely worried when I was a set and a break down against Gilles Simon because I felt a little bit flat and he came out playing extremely well. I didn't know if I was going to be able to turn that around.\nThankfully, at the right time I found a little bit extra and got the momentum on my side.\nIn the first and second matches I had really made a point of getting the crowd involved and it helped a lot, but to be honest on Sunday I didn't use the crowd quite as much, or celebrate so often, because I was so tired! I had to conserve my energy.\nCelebrating wildly after winning a big point is great when you're fresh, but that does also use up energy as well. I tried as best I could to just play each point at a time, even though I was getting frustrated and emotional.\nThe team at the side of the court is also important in helping you through tough times on court, and my fitness trainer, Matt Little, is one of the best at getting everybody going - although I don't think he likes the tag of cheerleader! He's a lot more than that.\nHe's a passionate guy and has been part of the team for the last five or six years, and I've known him for a lot longer than that. He's good at his job, first and foremost, but he cares about British tennis and supports the team very well.\nOur captain, Leon Smith, has put together a great group of guys who give everything to the cause.\nIt's not easy playing three such big matches within three days, it is challenging and now I need to make sure I manage my body well, listen to my team and get as much rest as possible.\nIt's been a long first seven months of the year. I don't think I've ever played this much tennis in my life at this stage of a season and it has been tough.\nAt different times my body has not felt great, but I've managed to make the most of it. I don't always want to be playing something like 30 matches in 80 days though, I don't think that's great in the long term.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI don't know when I'll start hitting again but I will probably head to Washington for my next tournament in about 10 days or so. I won't have time to go to Miami and do any preparation this year so will probably rest up for at least a week, then start training and head over to the States to get ready there.\nBefore that, I'm going away on holiday and heading for the beach. I don't plan on doing much, just relaxing and getting some time away from tennis to recharge.\nThe Davis Cup crowds at Queen's Club and in Glasgow this year have been unbelievable, the sort of experiences I will never forget.

    "document": "\"[President Barack] Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems,\" he tweeted. \"Forget Syria and make America great again!\"\nTwo years ago Mr Trump built a winning presidential campaign around this very theme, sharply criticising Democrats and some fellow Republicans for what he viewed as their overly interventionist foreign policies.\nJust a week ago Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to be following this new script when he downplayed calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's removal, saying his status \"will be decided by the Syrian people\".\nThen on Thursday night, two days after another chemical weapons attack, President Donald Trump ordered a guided missile strike on a Syrian government airfield.\nThe move marks a dramatic turnaround from Mr Trump's prior rhetoric and the expectations of how he would conduct his foreign policy.\nIn his remarks following the missile strike, the president explained that it was in the \"vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons\".\nHe even called on \"civilised nations\" to end the \"bloodshed and slaughter\" of the Syrian civil war and insisted that \"peace and harmony\" will prevail.\nThe man who was thought to be a neo-isolationist now, just months into his presidency, is projecting US military force abroad to enforce international norms and punish human rights abuses.\nWhat changed? It seems clear that the graphic images of dead and dying Syrian civilians - including \"beautiful babies\", in Mr Trump's words - had a dramatic effect on the president's disposition.\nWith a few notable exceptions, the strike is being praised by Washington politicians on the left and on the right. In the coming days, however, some serious questions will be posed.\nIf the president's foreign policy outlook can shift so dramatically in just a few days, if not hours, will allies and adversaries interpret this as a sign of flexibility or incoherence?\nA cruise missile strike is a low-risk form of military action, but it also is of limited effectiveness.\nA White House official described this as a warning shot across Mr Assad's bow.\nIf the Syrian president continues to use chemical weapons or conduct conventional attacks that result in significant civilian casualties, will the US escalate its military intervention or back down and risk appearing weak?\nWhen Mr Obama contemplated using force against the Syrian government, he decided that he would need congressional authorisation to do so. Will Mr Trump now seek approval from the lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, who were reluctant to give the Democratic president such approval?\nThursday night was Mr Trump's first significant foreign policy challenge, and it appears to have dramatically changed his outlook, his rhetoric and his resulting actions. The candidate who constantly spoke of putting America first ended his brief remarks on Thursday night by calling for God's blessings not just for his nation but for the \"entire world\".\nThis strike - and this change of attitude - may simply be a one-off event. Or, perhaps, an unlikely globalist has been born.",

The Ivory Coast international has two weeks to appeal against the decision.\n\"He has relied on other people and other people have let him down,\" added Allardyce.\nEboue, who has not made a first team appearance for the Black Cats, had been ordered by Fifa to pay agent Sebastien Boisseau an undisclosed amount he was entitled to under the terms of an agreement between the pair.\nThe former Arsenal full-back was fined 30,000 Swiss francs (£21,000) in September 2014 and given four months to settle the matter.\nEboue spent eight seasons at the Gunners after arriving from Belgian side Beveren in 2004, before moving to Turkey, where he won three Super Lig titles and five domestic trophies with Galatasaray.\nHe began training with Sunderland in February.\nGhanaian football agent Oliver Arthur told BBC World Service that it was \"very disappointing\" that Eboue had got \"into this mess\". He said the situation sometimes occurs when a player moves to a bigger agent and forgets to pay their previous representative.\nArthur said the ban was \"fantastic\" news for agents because it showed they can \"take your case to a higher level\".\n\"Now it's very easy to refer a player to a case like this and it's easy for them to understand. A lot of players will now think twice in their decisions, think twice in keeping money and waiting to pay. Agents fees aren't so big that players should get themselves into this mess.\"\nAllardyce was speaking for the first time since ex-Sunderland winger Adam Johnson was jailed for child sex offences last week.\nThe 28-year-old had been allowed to continue to play for the club, before being sacked when he pleaded guilty to two offences at the start of his trial. He has lodged an appeal against his conviction for a third offence of sexual touching.\n\"We've lost a hugely talented player in Adam Johnson, irrespective of his indiscretions,\" said Allardyce.\n\"He obviously got what he deserved, but we've lost a talented player I would've liked to keep. But it was taken out of our hands by other factors.\"",

The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining.\nIn addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge.\nBotswana needs to come up with unique enterprises to compete effectively with South Africa, says Dr Tebogo Seleka, executive director of the Botswana Institute for Development Policy Analysis (Bidpa).\n\"We are both in SACU (Southern African Customs Union), that means goods can enter freely, so if we chose those enterprises that South Africa is more competitive at, that puts us at a disadvantage,\" he says.\nThe key to Botswana's future diversity, many believe, lies in private sector development, and attracting foreign direct investment.\nDr Seleka also believes that due to the country's proximity, combined with its diminutive population, investors tend to set up shop next door.\n\"If a firm from overseas wants to locate in southern Africa, because of Botswana's market size we are at a disadvantage,\" Dr Seleka says.\n\"We also need to look at technology readiness, if you look at the types of technologies firms use, and the rate of adoption of new technologies in Botswana it is still not up to scratch.\"\nOne of the solutions to beefing up diversity in the country's economy may lie with its most abundant animal population.\nCattle outnumber the human population by over a million, and beef is the country's third-largest earner.\nBut despite this, agriculture, in its entirety, only makes up 3% of Botswana's economy.\nBakang Tsheboagae, a cattle farmer from Dutlwe, a village in the Kweneng District of Botswana, says the techniques his family have used for generations to manage their cattle herds have hindered his growth.\nHistorically our way of tracking cattle are earmarks, which are identical, and you can only brand them once they reach a certain age,\" he says.\n\"Livestock multiply, and as you multiply it becomes so difficult to count them, or to know which one is where.\"\nBotswana's cattle and beef industry is driven by exports to Europe, and in order export their beef, farmers must produce traceability records.\n\"I would say whoever has livestock; small, medium or large scale, ultimately you need a tool that will help you account for whatever you are doing,\" says Mr Tsheboagae.\nEnter a new breed of entrepreneur, using technology to modernise the sector.\nThuto Gaotingwe, 26, has developed cattle tracking software Modisar - named after the Tswana word for a herd boy.\nMr Gaotingwe has managed to realise his vision through the help of a one of the government's new entrepreneurial incubators, the Botswana Innovation Hub.\nKnown as a \"quasi government institution\", the innovation hub is described on its website as part of the state's \"national strategic goal for the diversification of the country's economyâ€¦ set up to support new ventures and existing companies.\"\nModisar is a productivity software application that can be installed on a farmer's computer or laptop, and allows the farmer to capture information about his or her farm faster.\nMr Gaotingwe explains: \"We are trying to say, 'look you can make money off livestock farming, only if you do it the right way'.\n\"So we have built Modisar, and it allows farmers to keep records of his farm assets. Then it allows farmers to know more about livestock diseases.\"\nAlthough criticised for being reactive as opposed to proactive, the government has implemented a number of policies, strategies and incentive schemes to encourage diversification.\nAn Economic Diversifiation Drive (EDD), for example, has been implemented to strengthen the private sector.\nThe EDD plans to leverage the government's purchasing power, estimated at $2.1bn (Â£1.3bn) per annum, to stimulate local production and consumption by buying from locally based manufacturers and service providers.\nLinah Mohohlo also explains that government has also begun exploring diversification options with in mining sector.\n\"You are now seeing other minerals, such as coal, uranium, copper, nickel coming on-stream,\" says Ms Mohohlo.\nDespite facing obstacles, with the right long-term developmental strategies, Botswana has huge potential to diversify.",

It evokes memories of all the great games of the past but, looking to the future, Bath are potential challengers to a Tigers team that will want to put down a marker.\nThroughout my career, games against Leicester - as well as local rivals Gloucester and Bristol - were the biggest games that Bath played in, perhaps because of three cup finals Bath won in 1989, 1994 and 1996.\nAt the time, both teams were used to winning and were full of current or previous internationals players. Who wouldn't want to be involved in those games?\nThe contests were always full of tension, particularly the 1996 final when we got a penalty try to win 16-15. At the end of the game Leicester's Neil back mistook team-mate Steve Lander for Bath's Andy Robinson and pushed him over.\nWith a comfortable win at Newcastle on the opening weekend, Bath have got off to a good start. However, the visit of Leicester is one of the biggest tests of the season and it is good that it arrives early.\nThe Tigers challenge will show this relatively new Bath team where they are and how much further they need to go.\nFly-half George Ford ran the game well against the Falcons last week in poor conditions, he was tactically good and nailed most of his kicks.\nThe Tigers know him well and I'm sure the likes of Julian Salvi and Jordan Crane would like the opportunity to get some tackling practice in on their former team-mate.\nIndividually, Bath have exciting backs like Kyle Eastmond, Jonathan Joseph, Nick Abendanon, Tom Heathcote, Anthony Watson, Tom Biggs, Semesa Rokoduguni, Gavin Henson and more.\nWe await to see what they can collectively produce, especially as there are high expectations to deal with.\nYou have to admire the Tigers - the club, supporters, playing squad and management.\nFriday\nHarlequins v Northampton - Quins win\nSale v Newcastle  - Sale win\nSaturday\nExeter v London Wasps - Exeter win\nWorcester v London Irish - Warriors win\nBath v Leicester - Bath win\nSunday\nSaracens v Gloucester - Sarries win\nThis weekend's full fixture list\nOver the years they have been brilliant at maintaining their values by recruiting the right players. By that, I mean they have signed players that aren't always the best in their position but are seen as the right fit for the Tigers culture. That's very important.\nThe Tigers expects nothing less than 100% commitment on and off the field and expect their players to abide by the culture and code of conduct set out.\nYou may think that's the case at every club. It's not - and that is one of the reasons that the others have struggled to match Leicester.\nLeicester ran over Worcester last week and they will look to power through Bath with more aggression and precision at the breakdown. They will look to make Bath players ask themselves whether they have what it takes to be a top-four team. Have they got the heart and soul for the fight?\nFly-half Ryan Lamb had a mixed game last weekend but that's what you get from a player who tends to play what he sees rather than what might have been planned. He does the unexpected, which is different to Toby Flood.\nFlanker Tom Croft, who is out for the season with a knee injury, is a huge loss and we all wish him a speedy recovery.\nBath want to change from last season's defensive displays and test themselves with a more balanced style. This new game plan will be given a severe test against the Tigers.\nOutside the clear colossal forward engagement that will take place, Bath's most important player will be Ford. If he has the clear mind to make the right decisions and produce a big-game performance, Bath will win.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBath have been starved of success for some time now, but they have begun a journey under new owner Bruce Craig, who has arrived with ideas that are ambitious, but certainly not impossible.\nBefore Craig arrived, Bath had, in my opinion, lost their on-field identity, with no recognisable style. Only under Steve Meehan did they give the impression that something was building, but that ended and another unsuccessful period started.\nFor quite some time Bath haven't had enough quality players or guys who have wanted to work hard enough to earn success. Gary Gold, Mike Ford and their team of coaches have to create that environment.\nOff the pitch you can see the changes, the club's administration and training facilities all under the same roof at Farleigh Manor, providing a great working habitat.\nIt's hoped the Recreation Ground could house a new stadium for 2015. Maybe Bath will have a winning team by then.",

    "document": "Now the carmaker has confirmed that it will release an all-new version of the Defender in 2015.\nA concept car on which the new Defender will be based is set to make its public debut at next month's Frankfurt motor show.\nArguably, the overhaul cannot come too soon for a vehicle that now feels hopelessly outdated next to the company's latest offering, the Range Rover Evoque.\nGoing from a rugged Defender to a flashy-looking Evoque is a major step.\nHowever, whether it is a step in the right direction is not clear - it really depends on what you want.\nWith its roomy, minimalist cabin and a square body, which many say only looks better once it has had a few knocks, the current Defender is obviously better suited as a serious workhorse.\nBut for the fashion-conscious who prefer a more comfortable ride and a lavishly fitted out interior, the Evoque might be a better bet.\nThe same may well be true for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK-based Tata Motors subsidiary that hopes to boost the profits it makes from both Range Rover and Land Rover vehicles.\nLand Rover is eager to conquer new markets at a time when competent rivals are enjoying great success in attracting farmers, workers and soldiers, offering them working vehicles that are often both better and cheaper than the Defender.\nLand Rover's global brand director, John Edwards, is hopeful the Evoque's lightweight construction and relatively low fuel consumption and emissions make it well suited to the job.\n\"This car will be our best-selling model,\" he says in an interview with BBC News, predicting that it will outsell Land Rover's Freelander, Discovery and Defender models, as well as the full-size Range Rover and Range Rover Sport.\n\"The sports utility vehicle (SUV) market is growing, but downsizing, and the premium market is growing in general,\" he observes. \"This meets those two trends quite well.\"\nCrowned Car of the Year 2011 by Auto Express, the Evoque is expected to broaden Land Rover's customer base.\nAbout half the buyers of the compact Evoque SUV are expected to be women, compared with just a quarter of Land Rover's current customers, and it is also expected to appear to a younger audience.\nMany of them will probably opt for a cheaper and more frugal two-wheel-drive version, rather than one kitted out with four-wheel-drive.\nMoreover, some 80% of the Evoques, which will be made at Land Rover's Halewood factory, will be sold abroad.\n\"We intend it to be a global car,\" Mr Edwards says.\nBut the Evoque is more than just a response to the market, according to Land Rover's managing director, Colin Green.\n\"With previous cars like the Freelander and Discovery, we've been looking at emerging segments, whereas with the Evoque we're trying to identify 'white space',\" he tells BBC News in an interview.\n\"The design has led the package, rather than the functionality leading the design.\"\nThat seems to be a major change in philosophy for Land Rover, which has traditionally been one of the most pragmatic, problem-solving companies in the motor industry.\nIt is also a strategy that is changing the company's makeup, with its upmarket Range Rover models destined to outshine its Land Rover models.\n\"I think Range Rover will make up more than 50% of sales by 2030,\" Mr Green says.\nThis might suggest a shift away from the company's core offroad values.\nBut Mr Edwards is eager to stress that the Evoque is \"just as capable, if not more capable on some surfaces, than some of our other models\".\n\"They offer luxury, plus the Land Rover capability,\" he says.\nDriving the Evoque on rutted tracks in Snowdonia makes it clear that the company's smaller, cheaper Range Rover is not a soft-roader. It is a perfectly able offroad vehicle, even when faced with fairly serious challenges.\nAnd with most of its offroad capabilities controlled by electronics, such as an adaptive damping system, it is also much smoother in the rough, with little room for human error by the button-pressing iPad generation that is expected to be buying it.\nThat prompts the question: redesign or no redesign, is the Defender quite simply obsolete?\n\"It's very long in the tooth,\" acknowledges Mr Edwards, though he nevertheless insists the Defender remains relevant.\n\"It's very important that we don't forget Land Rover and its capability. We are working very hard on the non-Range Rover badge products in our range.\n\"Replacing [the Defender] is going to be quite a challenge, but also an opportunity,\" says Mr Edwards. \"But we're definitely doing it.\n\"We'll want to replace the car as it currently occupies the market. We certainly don't want to move it upmarket and become a sort of 'Range Rover Defender'. That doesn't work at all.\"\n\"One of our problems in the past looking to replace the Defender has been to get the business case together,\" observes managing director Mr Green. \"Military contracts are fine, but you might get 5,000 orders one year, 200 the next.\"\nA more promising market might be in developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, where working vehicle sales are booming in parallel with rapid economic growth that is predicted to continue for decades yet.\nTo succeed in these markets, a new Defender will need to be able to compete on both price and quality. It will  need to be both cheaper - so the cost of production will need to come down - and better, in terms of both capabilities and fuel economy.\nAnd that may well prove an even trickier challenge than the creation of an urban warrior with designer looks.",

    "document": "This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume.\nWales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated.\nThis was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters.\nThe bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights.\nAs well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'.\nThere was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships.\nBut Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite.\n\"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long,\" said Coleman.\n\"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that.\"\nWales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed.\nIt is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home.\nWith every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium.\nHe saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him\nThe messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack.\nDespite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making.\nIn the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection.\nHal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu.\nThere was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: \"When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off.\"\nFrom a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players.\nGareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football.\nFor all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success.\nThe vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends.\nEven when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best.\nThese genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football.\nThe death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side.\nCaptain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal.\n\"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today,\" he said. \"He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.\"\nSpeed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of \"There's only one Speedo\" heard at every game.\nA friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not.\nSucceeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud.\nColeman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey.\nAbsent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait.\nThe current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success.\n\"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves,\" he said.\n\"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack.\"\nWales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup.\nPlanning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement.\nJust as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff.\nReturning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.",

    "document": "Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks.\nIt's not that human fingers are filthy. Those smears come about thanks to a mix of physiology and good grooming habits, said Steve Block, an electronics industry scientist at Dow Corning, which makes coatings that get applied to touchable screens.\n\"There's a whole range of things that can contaminate those surfaces,\" he said. \"There are natural oils on the fingers as well as the lotions people put their hands. Then there's cosmetics and the times when you hold your telephone up to your ear and it's sweaty.\"\nSmall wonder then that the sight of those smears is unsettling.\nThankfully, there is no reason to fret, as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you, said Prof  Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona.\n\"Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes, but not much of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since, if you are the only one using it, it's only your germs,\" he told the BBC.\nSadly, that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use, such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout, by patients in a doctor's waiting room or in a family that passes the gadget around.\nStudies by Prof Gerba and colleagues have shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people.\n\"We have traced the spread of MRSA skin infection among teenagers that shared a cell phone,\" he said. \"You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US.\"\nTouchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens\", said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets.\nIt is worth keeping those surfaces clean, said Prof Gerba, even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low.\n\"For viruses it can take as little one to make you ill, but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness, others a few hundred,\" he said. \"It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right time.\"\nThe study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and killing off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), did a good job of disinfecting the screens. However, regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny, very expensive gadgets would favour.\nThankfully, other fixes are at hand.\nTo begin with, said Mr Block, screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easy to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass, he said, but of a very particular type. Typically, he said, they and the coatings covering them are engineered to the most minute scale.\n\"They are made of very specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications,\" said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secretions and substances that can end up on a touchscreen.\nAlso, said Mr Block, they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is bought.\nThere are other innovations that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that, it claims, repels up to 50% more of the oil and other residues found on fingers. In addition, once applied, the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help hide smudges to help screens stay sharp.\nThe fourth generation of Gorilla Glass, which is used on many touchscreen gadgets, will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the next couple of years.\nThen there is the work of scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny bumps that trap water. Insects that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet.\nBy mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant, the researchers created a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work is still in the lab but is more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use.\n\"Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display,\" said Mr Block.",

    "document": "Maya Kodnani, an ex-minister and aide to Chief Minister Narendra Modi, is the most senior figure so far convicted.\nThirty others received life sentences for their part in the killings in Naroda Patiya, a suburb of Ahmedabad.\nThe riots left more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead, and were among India's worst outbreaks of unrest.\nThe rioting began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a train fire blamed on Muslims in the town of Godhra.\nKodnani was not a minister at the time of the riots, but was appointed junior minister for women and child development by Mr Modi in 2007.\nShe quit her post when she was arrested in 2009 in connection with the massacre but remained a member of the state assembly.\nOn Wednesday she was convicted of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy. Thirty-one others were also found guilty of involvement in the case. One of those convicted has never been brought to justice and was tried in absentia.\nBabu Bajrangi, a former leader of the hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal, was found guilty on the same charges as Kodnani. He has been sentenced to remain in jail until he dies.\nAnnouncing the sentences on Friday, Judge Jyotsna Yagnik named Kodnani as \"a kingpin of riots\" in the Naroda Patiya area.\n\"Communal riots are like cancer on constitutional secularism and the incident in Naroda Patiya was a black chapter in the history of the Indian constitution,\" the Press Trust of India quoted him as saying.\n\"Acts of communal [religious] violence are brutal, inhuman and shameful. It was a clear incident of human rights violation as 97 people were killed brutally within a day which included helpless women, children, aged persons.\n\"The climax of this inhuman and brutal act of violence was reflected in [the] murder of an infant, who was 20 days old,\" the judge said.\nFollowing Kodnani's conviction on Wednesday, Gujarat's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government quickly distanced itself from her saying that she had not been a state minister at the time of the riots.\nCorrespondents, however, say her conviction is an embarrassment for Mr Modi who elevated her to ministerial office in 2007 despite being aware that her role in the riots was being investigated.\nGujarat assembly elections are due later in the year and the Congress party is bound to use the court ruling to criticise Mr Modi during the campaign.\nMr Modi, touted by some as a future prime minister, has been accused of not doing anything to stop the riots - a charge he has always denied.\nNinety-five bodies were found after the Naroda Patiya massacre - the worst of the Gujarat riots cases - on 28 February 2002. The bodies of two other people missing after the massacre and presumed dead were never found.\nThe trial began in August 2009 and charges were brought against 62 people. One of the accused died during the trial.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story referred to the Bajrang Dal as a militant Hindu group.",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe fact the cost of watching football in Britain has mostly remained the same or even become cheaper, suggests pressure from supporters and government has finally had an impact after the ticket price inflation of recent seasons, along with clubs becoming more prepared to pass on more of their ever-increasing broadcast rights revenues to their customers.\nHowever, it appears the sport is still becoming more expensive for the poorest fans who want to go and watch occasional matches.\nThe average price of the cheapest match-day ticket has gone through the £30 barrier for the first time in the Premier League, a rise of 6.5%. Across the top five leagues of English football the cost is £22. And while inflation seems to have eased for season tickets, fans still face increasing expense when it comes to official merchandise.\nLast year, the then sports minister Helen Grant told me she was \"cross and concerned\" about ticket prices, and asked clubs to review their customer strategy after it was revealed the average price of the cheapest tickets had risen at almost twice the rate of inflation since 2011.\nThat led to fears that clubs had lost touch with some fans, and ran the risk of pricing some traditional supporters out of the game, along with younger fans. It looks like that message has partially got through, because we now learn that 70% of tickets (two-thirds in the Premier League) have been frozen or even reduced this year.\nClick here to play with the Price of Football calculator and see what your support is costing you.\nThe Premier League has grown increasingly frustrated with surveys focusing on ticket prices, believing they are too simplistic and fail to take into account the complexities of pricing structure, along with various initiatives.\nThey also point to the fact that crowds are as healthy as ever, with record 96% occupancy at stadiums and that 40% of those attending are aged 18-34.\nHence, the Premier League recently published its own research, showing that season ticket holders - who make up two-thirds of top-flight crowds - paid an average of £32.50 for adults and just £10 for juniors.\nThe Football League also says it rewards loyalty with average price paid per spectator as low as £14 across the 72 member clubs.\nSome clubs do more than others, of course. At Everton for example, the average price for a season ticket has fallen in real terms by 23% over the last 10 years, with under-11s paying just £5 per game.\nSome will see that all this as decent value for one of the most compelling leagues in the world, comparing favourably with other sporting events and entertainment.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOthers, however, will argue that in a period of almost zero inflation, and after the Premier League announced the biggest TV deal in football history in February, worth some £5.136 billion (a 70% increase), freezing ticket prices is the least they should be doing.\nThis all comes at a time of continued anger by some fans at the prices they are expected to pay. In 2013, Man City supporters protested at being charged £62 for tickets at Emirates Stadium, and there have been a number of demonstrations and marches at spiralling costs ever since.\nThe Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) has been calling for more affordable tickets with its 'Twenty's Plenty' campaign, designed to lobby clubs to cap prices for away fans at £20.\nSwansea City already caps away tickets for their supporters at £22, with other clubs committing to a range of reciprocal deals over certain fixtures. The FSF says if each club contributed £1m per season, its £20 price target could be met for all away fans. It also says that the Premier League clubs should use some of the £24m they saved on unpaid parachute payments to Norwich City, after the club bounced back to the Premier League following relegation.\nTo be fair, the Premier League has listened. This is the third season of its Away Fans Fund, which sees each club set aside £200,000 every year to help subsidise tickets and transport costs for travelling supporters.\nThe FSF says it is pleasantly surprised by the way the clubs have engaged, and £738,000 has now been saved for the country's 70,000 Premier League regular away fans through the scheme. That works out at about £10 for each supporter.\nHowever, at a time when some top players get paid £200,000 for around five days work, and when the cost of watching live football on TV is more expensive than anywhere else in Europe, the FSF now wants the Premier League to go much further.\nIt makes the point that the additional revenue from the £5bn domestic television deal alone (with the forthcoming overseas TV deal expected to result in an another £3bn) equates to £46 for every fan at every game.\nThere is mounting evidence, however, that the Premier League is willing to redistribute more of its wealth and play a greater role in society.\nAlthough some want more, clubs have committed to share £1bn over the three years of the new TV deal, with 'fan engagement' one of five areas set to benefit.\nClubs have already promised to pay the living wage for their staff, improve facilities for disabled fans, and have agreed to expand a school sport programme to every primary school in England and Wales. I'm told the clubs intend to do more to help with ticket affordability but want to wait to see how much is generated from their overseas TV rights deal, and the result of an Ofcom investigation into how those TV rights are sold.\nBut the price of football is about more than just tickets.\nThe BBC study found that the 20 Premier League clubs brought out 50 new strips this season - 10 clubs putting new third kits on sale.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAll the teams now change their strips each year. The average cost of an adult shirt in the Premier League is now almost £50 thanks to a 4.82% increase in the average price this season, with 10 clubs putting their prices up. A full adult strip at Manchester United would set you back £118 (a junior kit is £103).\nThe clubs say this is driven by consumer demand, but others believe supporters are being taken advantage of.\nThe top clubs have to compete with wealthy European rivals like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain for the world's best playing talent, and after another season of disappointing Champions League performances by English representatives, the need to maximise match-day revenue to sustain on-field performance is a persuasive one. After all, the clubs are businesses, geared to providing the best football competition, not charities.\nOn the other hand, critics can point to the £115m that clubs paid in agents' fees last year alone, and are entitled to ask whether ticket prices are still too expensive, especially when compared to some leagues abroad, including Germany and Spain - where a season ticket at Barcelona can be picked up for as little as £78 (on top of an annual membership fee).\nMany feel that football is unlike any other business and fans should be treated as more than mere customers. If you have been brought up as a loyal follower of a club, it is not easy to just switch allegiance to an alternative football provider. Some think the clubs need to remember that.\nPrepare for the protests to continue, regardless of the price freezes that this year's fifth BBC annual study has revealed.\nYou can download the full results for 2015 here (pdf 536 KB).",

The Commission hopes the deal can be signed with Canada at the end of October, so that it can then go to the European Parliament for ratification. But it will also need to be ratified by national parliaments across the EU.\n\"What we are discussing with the Canadians is if we should make some clarifications, a declaration so that we can cover some of those concerns,\" Ms Malmstrom said.\nShe acknowledged fears in some countries that politicians might see their \"the right to regulate\" diluted. \"Maybe that [right] needs to be even clearer in a declaration,\" she said, admitting that the CETA negotiations were still \"difficult\".\nKaroline Graswander-Hainz, an Austrian Socialist MEP, said the EU's top court - the European Court of Justice - must first examine the proposed Investment Court System (ICS) to check its legality.\nCETA holds \"great risks\" for Europe, she warned, adding that some of her fellow MEPs thought likewise.\nGerman Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel called CETA \"a model for future deals\".\nBut he was pessimistic about TTIP. \"The Americans were not prepared to make Europe offers that Canada made, and so there will definitely not be a [TTIP] deal this year,\" he said.\nSupporters of CETA and TTIP say such deals could set global trade standards, warning that failure could mean China setting the standards.\nCETA and TTIP promise to remove tariffs and non-tariff barriers, boosting growth on both sides of the Atlantic, free trade advocates say.",

    "document": "Mr Johnson highlighted growing concerns among students about not getting good value for money.\nHe also warned universities to stop \"excessive\" pay for vice-chancellors.\nBut Mr Johnson rejected calls to scrap tuition fees - saying it would be a \"disaster of historic proportions\".\nThe Russell Group of leading universities was lukewarm in its response to the idea of a binding contract - warning of \"unintended consequences\" and saying that \"no one would want to see standards undermined by the risk of legal action\".\nLabour said that talk about value for money for students was a \"smokescreen\" to cover for the unpopularity of the rising cost of fees.\nIn a speech to the Reform think tank in London, Mr Johnson fought back against calls to stop the rise in tuition fees and interest rates on loans.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that higher fees of £9,250 and interest rates rising to 6.1% will mean graduates leaving university with debts of more than £50,000 on average.\nFormer Education Minister Lord Adonis has called such high levels of fees and interest charges \"indefensible\", and the head of the Russell Group of universities has called for a reassessment of interest rates.\nBut Mr Johnson, while saying such charges would be kept \"under review\", he defended the principles underlying the current system as progressive and providing the funding for extra university places.\nMr Johnson said it was \"outrageous\" and \"entirely false\" to suggest that higher tuition fees had deterred disadvantaged students from going to university - and that entry rates for young people from poorer backgrounds were at record levels.\nLabour's policy of scrapping tuition fees would mean universities depending on government funding, said Mr Johnson, and he said that if higher education was competing against other pressures on public spending, universities would see their budgets squeezed.\nIt would mean a \"long decline into mediocrity\", said Mr Johnson, and a falling number of places.\nHe said the cost of scrapping fees, clearing existing student-loan debts and repaying students who had already paid off their loans would require a 2.5p hike in the basic rate of income tax.\nBut he also called for the university system to become much more responsive to the needs of students.\nMr Johnson said the newly established Office for Students would consider how to introduce contracts for all students, giving them a way of contesting the quality of their courses.\nThis would cover areas such as contact time, resources and assessments.\n\"Although contracts do exist in various forms in some institutions, most of them do not provide enough detail to be useful,\" said Mr Johnson.\n\"Providing students with greater contractual certainty\", said Mr Johnson, would \"help to address much of the dissatisfaction over seeming poor value-for-money of undergraduate education\".\nMr Johnson said such contracts would tackle problems of \"non-delivery\" for students and would give them \"some form of redress\", which could include \"legal remedies\".\nThe minister also told universities to restrain pay for vice-chancellors - with dozens of university heads now receiving over £300,000 and some being paid more than £400,000.\n\"When students and taxpayers invest so heavily in our higher education system, value for money should be guaranteed.  Yet, I am still hearing students say that their course is poor quality.\n\"This is not good enough, especially when some vice-chancellors take home a wage that in some cases exceeds that of the prime minister.\"\nBut Labour's universities spokesman, Gordon Marsden, said Mr Johnson was \"completely toothless\" over vice-chancellors' pay and his complaints would be \"kicked into the long grass\".\n\"His announcements today are a smokescreen to dodge mounting evidence that the cost of loans is pushing students away from applying to university and forcing more to drop out,\" said Mr Marsden.",

A few days ago, IRGC commander-in-chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said the NDF now had 100,000 fighters.\nGen Hamedani also said that 130,000 Basij militiamen and women were ready to go to Syria if necessary.\nIt is not clear how many Iranians have travelled to Syria to fight, but Iranian media do sometimes issue casualty reports.\nIn June 2015, the official Irna news agency said at least 400 Iranian and Iran-based Afghan \"volunteers\" had been killed in the past four years.\nPortraying them as \"volunteers\" may be an attempt to counter accusations that Iranian troops are involved directly in combat.\nFor possibly the same reason, most of the IRGC officers who have lost their lives in Syria have been described as \"retired\" or \"former\" members of the force.\nIn spite of such assertions, a senior politician has stated that Iran is prepared to join the war.\nA few days ago, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the chairman of the Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy committee, told a news conference in Damascus that Iran was ready to send troops to Syria if Mr Assad's government requested them.\nIt is possible that the defeats suffered by the Syrian army in recent months and the increased worldwide concern over IS have prompted Iran to act.\nHowever, Iran's foes worry that the IRGC may also now be feeling emboldened by the results of the recent nuclear deal, which paves the way for the lifting of sanctions, likely benefitting the force with a source of fresh funds.",

They offered a distinct contrast in styles.\nMr Rubio, a gifted politician, offered a polished set-piece, delivered from behind a lectern - compelling but traditional.\nIn contrast, Mr Cruz paced the stage with a wireless microphone. He waved his arms as he spoke and encouraged audience interaction. His appearance was more akin to a religious tent revival.\nDuring a news conference after his speech, Mr Rubio was asked early and often about his record on immigration and Mr Cruz's criticism.\nHe fired back that he was \"puzzled and surprised\" by Mr Cruz's words, since the Texas senator was on record supporting a legal status for undocumented workers as well and that their positions aren't \"dramatically different\".\n\"Everyone running for president on the Republican side in one way or another supports legalisation of some people who are here illegally,\" he said.\nEarlier in the day, Mr Cruz had told a radio interviewer that attempts by Mr Rubio to draw comparisons between their immigration views make him \"laugh out loud\".\nWhile he supported some legal status, his objection was to Mr Rubio's support for eventual citizenship for those who had entered the country illegally.\n\"That's like Obama saying my position is the same as his on Obamacare,\" Mr Cruz said. \"That's like the Ayatollah Khamenei saying my position is the same as his on the Iranian nuclear deal. It is laughingly, blazingly, on-its-face false.\"\nAt a rally in an evangelical church later on Friday, Mr Cruz announced an  immigration plan that would cap legal immigration and end automatic citizenship for those born on US soil.\nHe also took another not-so-veiled swipe at Mr Rubio, saying that those who supported the 2013 immigration reform effort - \"including some Republicans\" - were opting for the \"Washington cartel\" over \"hardworking American men and women\".\nThe two candidates are increasingly being viewed by pundits and Washington insiders as leading candidates to be the last two men standing when the Republican field eventually narrows. Such a theory is predicated on outsider candidates like Ben Carson and Donald Trump eventually fading, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush's campaign continuing to flounder and the other cast of candidates unable to gain traction.\nIf this turns out to be the case, then the fight between Mr Cruz and Mr Rubio over controlling illegal immigration - a topic that stirs passionate feelings among many Republican voters  -  isn't just a rhetorical November sideshow, it could help define how the Republican race plays out in the coming months.",

Others have advised against \"punishing\" the UK.\nSpeaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals.\n\"A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,\" he said.\n\"It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions... with certain individual countries.\"\nMr Kern said that Europe would not \"capitulate\" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member.\n\"If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,\" he said.\nThe EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier.\nSpeaking during a visit to Finland his UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, said he wanted an outcome which was good for the EU as well as the UK.\n\"We're not talking about a break-up, we're talking about a new relationship, that's what we want to see,\" he said.\nThe UK's former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said the negotiations - which are scheduled to be completed in two years - will be \"humungous\" in scope.\nPreparatory work has been taking place in more than 50 different sectors, spanning manufacturing and services as well as key industries such as farming and fishing.",

    "document": "This will affect businesses that use the VAT Flat Rate Scheme but which spend very little on goods, including raw materials - such as firms providing services.\nThe VAT Flat Rate Scheme simplifies businesses' record keeping, and makes it easy to work out the VAT they have to pay.\nThe proposed changes are the most important element of the Autumn Statement for this type of business.\nNormally a business deducts the VAT on its inputs (what they buy) from the VAT charged on what they sell (outputs).\nUnder the Flat Rate Scheme, that two stage process is simplified to one step.\nFor example, the flat rate percentage for a clothes shop is 7.5% - so if the owner of that shop sells a dress for £120 including VAT of £20 he will pay a flat rate of £9 (£120 x 7.5%) to HMRC.  The flat rate percentage for a detective agency is 12%.\nExactly which sales count can be complicated - the details can be found on the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) website.\nThe percentages for each type of business vary - there is a list here.\nThe flat rate scheme is designed to give the government roughly the same amount of VAT, but should be much easier to work out.\nHowever, because it is an approximation, some businesses will pay more, and some less.  The government is concerned that some businesses are using the Flat Rate Scheme to pay less VAT than is appropriate\nIn the Autumn Statement, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced changes which affect businesses which have a very low cost base. These businesses are now called \"limited cost traders\".\nLimited cost traders can still use the Flat Rate Scheme, but their percentage will be 16.5%.  So if they sell £120 of work, including £20 of VAT, the flat rate amount is £19.80 (£120 x 16.5%).\nA limited cost trader is defined as one that spends less than 2% of its sales on goods (not services) in an accounting period.\nWhen working out the amount spent on goods, it cannot include purchases of:\nA firm will also be a limited cost trader if it spends less than £1,000 a year, even if this is more than than 2% of the firm's turnover on goods.\nIt will increase the VAT paid by labour-intensive businesses where very little is spent on goods. For example, this may affect IT contractors, consultants, hairdressers and accountancy firms.\nIt will also affect construction workers who supply their labour, but where the raw materials are provided by the main contractor.\nMike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"Many small businesses rely on the optional VAT flat rate scheme to simplify the management of their tax affairs.\n\"We welcome the government's attempts to clamp down on any misuse of this scheme by a small minority of businesses that use it. However we would be concerned if any small businesses who play by the rules now end up having to pay more to remain within the scheme.\n\"Following these reforms, it is important HMRC now produces clear guidance so that small firms understand whether or not to join the scheme.\"\nThe new rules start on 1 April 2017, but may also affect invoices issued, and goods bought, from now on.\nThere is more about these \"anti-forestalling\" rules at sections 8.2 and 9.7 of the newly updated HMRC leaflet on the Flat Rate Scheme.\nThe scheme can be more complicated than expected, and this note is only an overview, so be sure to read the guidance carefully.",

I am looking forward to it.' I had been watching big Champions League games for years and now I was about to play in one myself.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI don't think anyone expected us to win but we genuinely were not afraid because we had been to the San Siro twice already that year as part of our amazing run to the last eight and, in Gareth Bale, we had a kid who had been ripping Europe apart.\nFor different reasons, City will also have a lot of optimism going into the tie.\nThis is their first semi-final but they have got a lot more Champions League experience than that Tottenham team, including two trips to the Nou Camp in the past two seasons.\nThe more times you are in those situations, the more you learn about how to deal with them.\nFour of the City team likely to start on Wednesday - Hart, Kompany, Gael Clichy and Yaya Toure, came within minutes of beating Real at the Bernabeu in 2012 when they led twice but lost to an injury-time Cristiano Ronaldo goal.\nAnd in Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas they have players who went there many times in La Liga when they played for Atletico Madrid and Sevilla.\nThey will be ready for the Bernabeu, and they certainly will not be scared.\nCity boss Manuel Pellegrini was spot on before the first leg when he said his players could not afford to lose their heads, and remembering that will be crucial for them on Wednesday.\nWe conceded early against Real, but it was a far bigger blow to our chances when Peter Crouch was sent off after being booked twice in the first 14 minutes, because our game plan went out of the window.\nPart of the problem is you get so pumped up for these matches and it is hard to contain that emotion.\nI only found out I was playing less than five minutes before kick-off because Aaron Lennon was unwell but I just remember walking out of the tunnel being more excited than anything else.\nCity players also have to remember that officials will feel the pressure of the Bernabeu crowd as much as the players, and a lot of decisions are more likely to go Real's way.\nThere is a difference in mentality too, because Spanish teams look at an opposition red card as a way of changing the course of the game to gain advantage.\nIt is a viable way of winning for them and they will do it again on Wednesday if they can, so City will have to be super clever to avoid that situation this time.\nIf you look at games between English and Spanish sides in the Champions League over the past 10 seasons, it is the English teams who have had far more players sent off - 11 red cards, compared to six.\nNo team - Spanish or English - has won any of those 16 games after going down to 10 men, and I don't think that would change if it happened to City this time.\nWhen it happened to Spurs at the Bernabeu, it turned into the hardest and weirdest game I have ever played in, because we just never got the ball.\nI was over on the right of a midfield diamond and Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo were running at me and Spurs right-back Vedran Corluka, although sometimes they just overloaded us with three or four players.\nIt was relentless - wave after wave of attacks from all angles, and in an electric atmosphere too because the crowd were in a frenzy.\nCorluka and I just looked at each other at one point, because we did not know what to do. You looked round for help but everyone else was exhausted too.\nIf City can keep any kind of control in the game, they can take the positive effects of playing in the Bernabeu away from Real and use it against them.\nThe longer it stays 0-0, the better it is for City and their first aim should be to keep the home crowd quiet, then get them on the Real players' backs.\nReal were sitting deep for most of the first leg but they cannot do that at home because they will get absolutely slaughtered by their supporters.\nThey have to attack and try to win the game and that will leave massive spaces for Kevin de Bruyne and Aguero to do what they did in the quarter-final, when City really exploited Paris St-Germain's expansive style and drew 2-2 in Paris.\nThe tie is in the balance at 0-0 after the first leg but City will be happier with that result because away goals are so important, and playing away from the Etihad seems to suit them a lot better in European competition anyhow.\nThey are capable of scoring as well as shutting Real out and I think they have the players to go there and win the game.\nJermaine Jenas was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan",

No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters.\nBut there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support.\nElection hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election.\nMagazine Monitor: Where did the word 'hustings' come from?\nThere have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity.\nI've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal.\nVoters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans.\nThey also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the \"noise\" of national campaigning.\nThat was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities.\nOn the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South.\nThere were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools.\nBut one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university?\nThe study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years.\nIt also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students.\nOne angry voice in the audience shouted: \"That's outrageous and disgraceful\".\nIt got backing from the Greens.\n\"That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market,\" said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley.\nThere was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff.\nA precise solution perhaps required a precise response.\nBut the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one.\n\"It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party,\" she told the questioner.\nAnd Labour's Dame Margaret?\n\"We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating. So your suggestion is exactly the kind of idea we will be looking at,\" she said.\nOne platform speaker wanted to go much further. Lucy Care, the Lib Dem's candidate for Derby North, suggested that all job application forms should no longer include the person's name.\n\"We would like to have name blank application forms,\" she said.\n\"So all you read is their experience and what they've done. Often the name of the applicant can deter some employers from short listing or recruiting.\"\nAs for UKIP's Derby South hopeful Victor Webb, he didn't completely rule out having such a recruitment audit, but: \"I wouldn't do this because of the burden of cost and regulation on small businesses.\"\nFor this hustings audience, maybe no instant solutions but they got the politicians thinking about their concerns.\n\"The key is getting people engaged,\" said Marc Grant, the event organiser.\n\"It's the first time we've held a hustings at the church.\"\n\"We wanted to show why politics is so important to our daily lives and I'm really pleased so many  people came along.\"\nWhatever the outcome of this election, the locally organised hustings have emerged as a big campaign winner.",

He lied again,\" said Ms Waters.\nShe also criticised Friday's announcement that President Donald Trump will not release the logs of those who visit the White House.\nThe White House cited \"grave national security risks and privacy concerns\" as the reason for its decision, reversing former President Barack Obama's voluntary disclosure policy.\nParticipants used the hashtag #showusyourtaxes to share their images on social media.\nPresident Trump's supporters have also gone online to express their support for the president.\nOne Twitter user accused protesters of \"flogging a dead horse\" and many said they had no interest in seeing the returns.\nSeparately, more than a dozen people were arrested in Berkeley, California, after supporters of Mr Trump clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators at a free speech rally, police said.\nSeveral people were injured when fighting broke out at a park in the city as opponents and supporters of the US president met on the streets during Saturday's protests, according to CNN.\nFootage shared on social media showed crowds of people throwing items at one another and demonstrators being attacked with what appeared to be chemical sprays and makeshift weapons.\nThe incident occurred after hundreds of anti-Trump protesters staged a counter-rally alongside an event billed as a \"Patriots Day free speech rally and picnic\", organised by the president's supporters.",

There is a lack of Europe in this union, and a lack of union in this union\".\nHe said tackling the crisis was \"a matter of humanity and human dignity. It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery in the world. But we have to put it into perspective.\n\"This still represents just 0.11% of the EU population. In Lebanon refugees represent 25% of the population.\"\nThe mass migration has seen those seeking an end to persecution, conflict and hardship travel from Turkey across the sea to Greece, through Macedonia and Serbia, and then to Hungary from where they aim to reach Austria, Germany and Sweden.\nOn Wednesday, Denmark suspended all rail links with Germany and shut a section of motorway after migrants crossed the border and began walking north, apparently trying to reach Sweden.\nIn southern Hungary, migrants on the border with Serbia broke through police lines at the Roszke camp, forcing the closure of the M5 highway.\nAmong Mr Juncker's proposals:\n\"It's 160,000 refugees in total that Europeans have to take into their arms and I really hope that this time everyone will be on board - no rhetoric, action is what is needed,\" he told MEPs.\nThe new plans would relocate 60% of those now in Italy, Greece and Hungary to Germany, France and Spain.\nThe numbers allocated to each country would depend on GDP, population, unemployment rate and asylum applications already processed.\nCountries refusing to take in migrants could face financial penalties.\n14 Sept: Special meeting of EU interior ministers on refugee crisis, with Juncker proposals on agenda\n15-16 Oct: EU leaders' summit, with refugee crisis high on agenda.

This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",

    "document": "To secure more rights for people with disabilities, she makes frequent visits to courtrooms where the world of beauty contests is but a dream.\nBut the first Miss Wheelchair India contest in Mumbai in late November changed much of that.\nShe found herself amid the humdrum of the green room, glitter of the stage and the usual chatter one associates with a beauty pageant.\nBut there were some marked differences - the stage was much smaller than the ones set up for Miss India pageant and the contestants were treated as winners even before the event started.\nMs Kewlani's reply is an emphatic \"no\" when asked if the smaller stage and venue dimmed the importance of India's first Miss Wheelchair contest.\n\"Nobody really cared about how many people attended the event or how big the stage was. It was a night to celebrate the courage and fighting spirit of the contestants. We all won that night.\"\nShe says that her \"rich and challenging\" life has taken another positive turn after winning the contest.\n\"Polio made me wheelchair-bound early on in life but I never saw it as a disability and worked hard to be trained as a media professional like other normal people in the country.\n\"And winning the pageant is just another way of showing that disability cannot stop you from feeling and looking beautiful,\" the 41-year-old says.\nDivya Arora feels her first runner-up crown has strengthened her belief that \"beauty is boundless\".\nMs Arora, who earlier worked for a leading newspaper, says her faith that \"disability can never overshadow her beauty and abilities\" helped her do well in the pageant.\nThe contest is the idea of tax consultant Sounak Banerjee whose life changed in 2006 when muscular dystrophy forced him to use a wheelchair to get around in the bustling city of Mumbai.\nMr Banerjee liked watching Bollywood films and TV shows but often found the absence of people with disabilities in the entertainment industry \"disturbing\".\n\"Disabled people are also consumers of the entertainment industry but they are seldom represented,\" he says.\nHe then came up with the idea of the Miss Wheelchair India contest to fill the gap and provide a platform they could call their own.\nPlanning the event was tough due to a lack of funding and human resources, he says but adds that the struggles were forgotten when the final day approached.\n\"I felt satisfied and happy when I saw these women wearing their best costumes and a winning smile. It all came together nicely in the end - I had done something for these courageous contestants,\" he says.\n\"I found the contest very unique because it honoured beauty irrespective of contestants' physical disabilities,\" says scientist Gopika Anand, 31, who won the second runner-up crown.\nMs Anand met with a road accident while studying engineering and was soon confined to a wheelchair. But she persevered, completed her course and found work as a scientist at a leading consumer manufacturing firm.\nShelly Bhutani, another contestant, hopes that the corporate world will take notice of the event in the future.\n\"I feel we too deserve to be in front of the camera and get brand endorsements like Miss India winners,\" she says.\nMs Arora, however, felt the organisers were not well prepared for the event and did not provide the kind of support she had hoped for.\nMr Banerjee accepts that a lack of sponsorship made the job of organising the event tough.\n\"I agree that there were problems at the event. We will work harder and hope that more people will support the event next year,\" he says.\nBut other contestants want to see change at a more basic level.\nIndia is not known to be a disabled-friendly country as most public places, monuments and buildings do not have facilities catering to their specific needs.\nBhavna Sharma, who won the contest in a category that honoured people who are disabled but not necessarily confined to a wheelchair, says citizens with disabilities do not feel inferior and have achieved success in almost every field.\n\"But it's the country's poor infrastructure for disabled people that lets us down,\" the 27-year-old says.\nSome years ago Neenu Kewlani travelled all over India in a chauffer-driven car to highlight the problems faced by those with physical challenges while commuting.\nShe says the problem is even more severe in rural areas and smaller towns where people with disabilities are virtually confined to their homes. Nearly every contestant expressed concern over a lack of sensitivity about disability rights.\nBut not one of them is willing to give up hope.\nMs Kewlani says there is a long way to go in making India a disabled-friendly country but \"we are not ready to give up as we are fighters\".\n\"Facilities are improving in cities but we will continue to put pressure on governments to ensure they provide better opportunities and infrastructure for the disabled,\" she adds.\nCalcutta-based Sarmistha Sinha says disability rights activists will have to continue fighting like other marginalised sections of the society.\nAn accident in 2006 confined the 41-year-old doctor to a wheelchair, but she says her \"thoughts and ability to stay positive remained free\".\nMs Sinha won in a category which honoured married women in a wheelchair. But winning was not everything for her as she wanted to use the platform to showcase her talent.\nThe wheelchair dancer saw the contest as an opportunity to present her skills and meet people like herself from all over the country. \"I only wanted to dance as such opportunities are rare but the feeling that I have won a beauty pageant is slowly sinking in,\" she adds.\nFor Gopika Anand the real winning moment came when she saw her father's moist eyes as the results were announced.\n\"I was overwhelmed to see her with the crown. I am very proud today to be recognised as Gopika Anand's father,\" says Anand Mohan.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

    "document": "Probably not - for two sets of reasons.\nFirst, the basic facts have not changed - there is no doubt that the situation inside the Labour Party remains dangerously unstable, with probably a majority of Labour MPs deeply uncomfortable with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.\nBut his is a leadership his party members want, overwhelmingly so. And were a coup to be staged the membership would either re-elect him, or elect someone similar.\nWe're in Bertolt Brecht territory here: the easiest solution for Corbyn-sceptic MPs would be to dissolve the party membership and elect another, as the poet ironically suggested for the Communist regime in 1953.\nBut, failing that, they have to wait for the membership to change its mind.\nThe tactics of any coup attempt revolve around the different views of what might have to occur to trigger such a change.\nSome think serious electoral reverses in next May's round of elections (the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, the London mayor etc) might do the trick.\nLondon could be particularly significant, both as the place where Labour did best at the election in May and as the heartland of the Corbynistas.\nThe argument is that the election of a Tory mayor and a rough ride on the doorstep might re-educate enough of the new wave of Labour members to allow a different leader to be elected.\nOthers argue that it might take two such rounds of May defeats to change enough minds. This, of course, relies on those defeats actually occurring, not to mention them having the effect the anti-Corbyn camp want. We shall see.\nAnd it's also worth underlining that the Syria intervention is an issue where Mr Corbyn is in tune with his membership.\nThen there's the not insignificant question of how a leadership challenge would be triggered.\nI'm told some Labour MPs have been digging into the archives to study how Hilary's dad, Tony Benn, went about challenging Neil Kinnock, in 1988, and that legal opinions on what Labour's murky and overlapping internal rules might actually mean are being studied in various Westminster offices.\nOne of the key questions is whether Mr Corbyn, if challenged, would need to be nominated by 35 MPs in order to defend his position or whether he would be assured of an automatic position on the ballot papers.\nSecond, there's the climate within the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). One of the key problems for the coup plotters is identifying an alternative leader, to play Michael Howard to Mr Corbyn's Iain Duncan Smith, and at least keep the Labour show on the road in the 2020 election.\nMr Benn has certainly put his head above the parapet - but he's done so on an issue that is highly divisive within the PLP, rather than one of the several causes which pit most Labour MPs against their leader.\nTake a look at the voting list on Wednesday, where two married couples - Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey and Jenny Chapman and Nick Smith - were split on the issue.\nIn that agonised atmosphere, Mr Benn's moral certainties may not play well in the longer term, whatever their on the day impact.\nHe may have given a masterly Commons performance (a real rarity these days) and made a powerful speech setting out the moral case for military intervention, in terms that had many Tory, as well as Labour, MPs swooning.\n\"He's clearly running for the leadership - but of which party?\" tittered one SNP MP.\nBut most of Mr Benn's Labour colleagues were conflicted about the issue of whether intervention would workâ€¦ and I'm not sure the appeal he made to their internationalist roots and to memories of Arthur Greenwood \"speaking for England\" in 1940 will have won over those who doubt both their leader and the case for military action.\nCertainly there were plenty of MPs from what might be called the \"right\" of the PLP who didn't back the government motion.\nSo it may be worth watching other figures who didn't break cover last night - Rachel Reeves, anyone?\nAll the same, Mr Corbyn's position has been weakened. He was forced to concede a free vote, under the threat of losing much of his shadow cabinet.\nHe was comprehensively outperformed by his shadow foreign secretary and some of his internal critics suspect that competence rather than ideology might be the most corrosive issue for his leadership.\nThis week also saw brutal meetings of the shadow cabinet and the PLP, and, ultimately, a significant chunk of the front bench voting with the government (Hilary Benn, Michael Dugher, Maria Eagle, Angela Eagle, Vernon Coaker, Tom Watson, Lucy Powell, Heidi Alexander, Chris Bryant, Gloria De Piero and Luciana Berger, for the record).\nAnd that list included one of his personal left-field picks for high office, the shadow health secretary Ms Alexander. She's proved an effective performer, but I suspect her name is mud in the Corbyn inner circle.\nNow there will be recriminations and, possibly, attempts at constituency level to deselect the recusants (there does not have to be a return to the '80s era of mandatory reselection; the coming Commons boundary changes will ensure most sitting MPs will not face a simple rubber-stamping to become their party's candidate again).\nIf they succeed, some MPs may quit immediately, forcing uncomfortable by-elections, or simply go rogue in the Commons and vote as they please.\nWe're still some way from further 80s retro developments like an SDP-style breakaway. And defections to the Liberal Democrats seem improbable, both because of the extent of their implosion last May and because a lot of Labour MPs regard the party's new leader, Tim Farron, as \"Corbyn lite\".\nSo we're left with a destabilised official opposition and no obvious way to resolve its problems that does not involve a major smackdown.\nThings will get worse in the Labour Party before they get better.\nFind out how your MP voted\nFind out which constituency you live in\n*The Commons is made up of 650 MPs but the Speaker and his three deputies cannot vote while Sinn Fein's four MPs do not take their seats and did not take part.\n*There is also currently no MP for Oldham West and Royton, with a by-election taking place on Thursday.",

Their faces were haunted and some had to be helped.\nThe children didn't even flinch when there was more sound of gunfire. An older woman was so weak she could barely walk. A few babies being carried looked almost lifeless.\nThe families were given food and water. This, their first taste of freedom after three years of living under IS control.

I made that video an hour before when we were allowed in his kennel with him.\"\nAnother former worker at the kennel, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Vinnie the Rottie had no human contact except being fed. He was deemed too dangerous to get out.\n\"But this was the dog that, once he knew you, wagged his tail, pushing himself against the bars, desperate for any attention.\n\"As far as I know he belonged to a man who trained him as a guard dog. Because he was possibly trained to bite we were told not to walk, go in with him, same as Stella as he was too dangerous.\"\nFormer staff at the kennels have told the BBC they offered to work with Vinnie and exercise him but were not given permission to do so.\nAfter the BBC revealed Stella's plight, Devon and Cornwall Police Chief Superintendent Jim Nye said: \"The welfare of dogs is extremely important to us.\n\"In the past year we have seized in the region of 100 dogs, and only Stella has been assessed as too dangerous and unpredictable for kennel staff to walk.\"\nFollowing the release of the latest video, the force did not say if they or another body had ordered Vinnie - who is understood to not be among the last 100 dogs seized - to be kept without human contact.\nHowever, in a statement they said: \"Vinnie the Rottweiler was a dog seized and placed into kennels in 2013.\n\"Vinnie was a legal breed and was seized after it had bitten three people. Later the courts granted a destruction order on the dog who was put to sleep in the early to mid part of 2015.\n\"Within the last 100 dogs we have seized only Stella was deemed too dangerous to be exercised and instructions given to the kennel specifically in relation to this.\n\"It is important to stress that despite the very best effort of the police, the judicial process is not accelerated when a dog is placed in kennels. This is immensely frustrating for the police who hold animal welfare in the highest regard.\"\nNo-one from the kennels has commented.",

Mr Cairns said: \"ThyssenKrupp are prepared to invest significant sums of money into a joint venture scheme with the offer of support from the UK government, and that in itself we can take encouragement from because that shows they're prepared to spend money.\"\nHe said taxpayers' money would only be used if there was a viable sustainable future in steelmaking.\nIt wouldn't be a Welsh affairs select committee without a question from David Davies on the Severn crossings. He was concerned that the government might try to make a profit out of them once they return to public ownership. Apparently, it won't.",

    "document": "The 21st Century successors to the Red Guards are not a physical presence. After the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and the tragedy of the Beijing massacre in 1989, young people are not allowed to demonstrate in China.\nBut some now hound their enemies online. The underlying rage is reminiscent. The instinct for intimidation is the same. Despite all its strengths and all its engagement with the world, China is once again prey to political groupthink and fear.\nThe latest trigger is a speech by a Chinese student at an American campus. On 21 May, at an official event, Shuping Yang praised the fresh air and freedom of speech she had found at the University of Maryland.\nThe video clip of her speech quickly went viral and triggered an outpouring of anger from fellow Chinese students in the US and critics at home. Shuping Yang swiftly apologised, asked forgiveness and said she had no intention to belittle her country. But that was not enough to stop the flood of \"I am proud of China\" posts accusing her of lies and deception, or the online \"human flesh searches\" to dig up incriminating information about her and her family.\nOf course there are good reasons to be proud of China and every Chinese citizen is entitled to list them. In the past week alone, China has sent a submersible deep into the Mariana Trench and its world champion go player Ke Jie took on the AlphaGo AI computer programme and almost beat it. Every day ordinary Chinese people display the energy, talent and hard work of which their fellow citizens should be proud.\nBut being proud of China does not mean denying another Chinese citizen the right to an opinion. In fact, Shuping Yang herself said she too was proud in her message of apology.\nThe irony is that the very backlash against her has only served to make her point about the want of freedom of speech in her homeland. It has also highlighted a conflict between a commitment to free speech in Western countries that host large communities of Chinese students and the growing determination of the Chinese government and some of its citizens that free speech should be limited when it comes to talking about China, even beyond Chinese borders.\nFreedom of speech is any society's feedback loop. It means precisely the freedom to say what is different or what may even offend. Of course, different societies have a different view on how much of this is appropriate. But if China's freedom of speech goes no further than parroting the leader and attacking those who dare to speak from a different script, then its spirit is lurking in the shadow of the Mao era.\nWhich brings us to Chairman Xi and his style of leadership. In English Xi Jinping is usually referred to as President Xi. But his power comes from being leader of the Communist Party and since taking up that role five years ago, he has collapsed the distinction between party and government and dramatically shrunk the space for freedom of speech.\nAll public debate, whether in the media, academia, the legal profession or online, is a shadow of what it was in 2012. It is now off-limits to discuss universal values or liberal democracy.  Instead China must loudly unite around the leadership of the Communist Party and \"tell China's story confidently\".\nConfidence is understandable. In Xi Jinping's first five-year term, China has become the world's second-largest economy and an increasingly powerful military power. But when Chairman Xi urges journalists, think-tanks and diplomats to \"tell China's story confidently\" he does not mean tell it how you like and with your own nuance. Students abroad are a particularly important voice in this chorus. It is stated Chinese government policy to \"assemble the broad numbers of students abroad as a positive patriotic energy\".\nAnd so when the University of California San Diego announced that it would host a speech by Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama next month, the local Chinese Students and Scholars Association consulted with diplomats and threatened \"tough measures to resolutely resist the school's unreasonable behaviour\". At Durham University in the UK, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, again with the support of the Chinese embassy, attempted to bar from a debate a critic of China's religious policies and human rights record.\nThis week's mobilisation against Shuping Yang, complete with commentaries in leading state media, is part of this drive for \"positive patriotic energy\".\nAll of which causes some bafflement on the campuses concerned. Students from countries with a tradition of free speech may feel irritation with someone who criticises their homeland in a public speech, but their instinct is usually to shrug it off or make a joke. Likewise when Chinese state media deploy students from Western countries praising China and its policies, such individuals do not become hate figures for outraged student associations or national newspapers.\nThat's because liberal societies take differences of opinion for granted. In the US, in Europe and in Australia, citizens regularly excoriate their own governments and praise other countries in the media, and on satirical TV and radio shows. They also mount protests against their leaders.\nIt is vital to Beijing that these habits should not rub off. So in Chairman Xi's era the numbers of Chinese students studying abroad is going up but their tolerance of diverging views on China is going down.\nIn one respect, this is puzzling. At great expense, young Chinese have chosen to move from the confines of China's tightly-controlled education system to the \"fresh air\" of campuses which cherish tolerance and which offer all the tools to explore a range of different narratives of their own place in the world through reading and debate. But it is not so puzzling if you factor in these students' prior ideological education, the pressure on them to perform academically, and the ever-present and watchful eye of the Chinese state.\nTension is likely to grow between the liberal values of Western campuses and the \"positive patriotic energy\" of the growing numbers of Chinese students on these campuses. But the very strength of the reaction to Shuping Yang's freedom speech ensures that her words will continue to echo.\nAfter all, it's not just Western culture which honours a loyal opposition. It is firmly entrenched in the historical memory of China too. Respect resonates down through the centuries for officials and soldiers in the imperial and the more recent Communist era who braved banishment or death for daring to speak truth to power.\nSo be #proudofChina by all means, but don't go back to the frenzy of the Red Guard era, and remember that in all great civilisations, the patriots whose memories endure are often those who love their country enough to point out its flaws.",

Without his imagination it would have been lost forever; so it's fitting that his son has gone on to be waterways manager on the Kennet and Avon Canal.\"\nIn its heyday the Swansea canal was a feat of 18th Century engineering; with 36 locks and five aqueducts carrying the water from 365ft (111m) at Abercraf, to where it reached sea-level at North Dock.\nFor a century and a half it carried around 400,000 tonnes of coal, iron and steel each year to feed the Industrial Revolution.\nIndeed, several towns and villages such as Ystradgynlais, Ystalyfera and Clydach owe their very existence to its success.\nBut by the turn of the 20th Century it was feeling the pinch from the competition of railways, and the last commercial barge to travel the canal was in 1931.\n\"So much of our history came down that canal, from the copper works of Swansea, to the iron of the valleys, The Mond Nickel Works, and what was at the time the biggest tinplate works in the world at Pontardawe,\" said Mr Davies.\n\"After its closure in 1931 it was briefly used during World War Two, but after that it was gradually covered over.\n\"Back then there was no interest in preservation. There's even a piece of 1960s BBC news footage, talking about what a fetid eyesore it was, and how it needed to be built-over as soon as possible.\"\nWhilst the reopening of lock number seven is still some years off, demolishing some of the transport depot and reinstating the towpath to extend Sustrans National Cycle Route 43 could be achieved relatively quickly.\nAttention will then turn to dredging the navigable section of silt, with a view to holding a trail boat festival there in 2019.\nMr Davies now believes that the time has come where public thinking has turned full-circle away from burying our past.\n\"With the success of projects like the extension of the Liverpool-Leeds canal, authorities are recognising that for every £1 they spend on restoration, they can make back £7 in tourism,\" he said.\n\"If we can get the Swansea canal to reach the Fendrod River, onto the Tawe, and back to the docks, from there it would only take a short section of new canal to meet up with the Neath and Tennant Canals.\n\"That would give us a U-shaped 35-mile (56km) stretch which would take around three days to cruise, and how much tourist revenue could that raise?\"",

    "document": "A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials.\nThe fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007.\nIf confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company.\nLast month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the \"London Whale\" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil.\nThe tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision.\nThe New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment.\nBut the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims.\nThe $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners.\nIn the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks.\nThese special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports.\nWhen the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments.\nWhat JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky.\nSome of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008.\nThe mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value.\nJP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said.\nThe bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors.\nJP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately.\nOnce the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn.\nThe bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year.\nJP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs.",

    "document": "Fleetwood shot a four-under-par 68 to keep pace with fellow overnight leader Brooks Koepka at Erin Hills, while Harman carded a 67 to lead on 12 under.\nPaul Casey, who also started on seven under, fell away with a three-over 75.\nJustin Thomas is tied for second after becoming the first man to shoot a nine-under-par round at the US Open and the fifth 63 in its 117-year history.\nThere had been four other 63s in US Open history before this week. Jonny Miller hit the first on the par-71 Oakmont in 1973, while Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf's efforts came on the par-70 Baltusrol in 1980.\nFiji's Vijay Singh also recorded a seven-under 63, at Olympia Fields in 2003.\nThe US Open tournament organisers have historically prided themselves on trying to make the winning score as close to level par as possible.\nHowever, heavy overnight rain dumped an inch of water on the course and that undoubtedly helped low scoring with players able to take advantage of receptive greens and attack the holes.\nThomas opened his round with two birdies before dropping a shot on the fourth. Four more birdies followed on the front nine before another bogey on the 10th looked to have put paid to his chances of breaking Miller's 44-year-old record.\nBut after three birdies in six holes, he eagled the 667-yard par-five 18th, hitting his second shot to eight feet from 300 yards and rolling in the downhill putt.\nSouthport's Fleetwood, who finished tied for 27th on his only other US Open appearance in 2015, appeared to be heading towards his second bogey-free round of the tournament after laying up with his second shot on the par-five 18th.\nHowever, he left his chip to the green short and then putted through the green and off it with his fourth shot. A sublime chip to three feet allowed him to escape with just his third bogey of the week.\n\"That was the best shot I hit all day,\" Fleetwood told BBC Sport.\n\"I hadn't been out of position all day and suddenly I was staring double bogey in the face.\n\"Bad shots make bogeys and 18 was a good example. I could still have been there now, hitting the ball over the green. But I hit the perfect shot and I was made up when I got on the green.\n\"Three days down and so far so good.\"\nFellow Englishman Casey was one of the four overnight leaders but he fared the worst, posting a triple bogey for the second day running as he dropped out of contention.\nHis downfall began with an errant second shot on the par-four third into deep rough. That led to a seven and a further shot went on the next hole.\nOn Friday, the 39-year-old responded with a run of five successive birdies but he was unable to replicate that on Saturday, as he ended the round on four under par.\nHome players occupy 12 of the top 16 places on the leaderboard and with six shots separating them, any one could still win on Sunday.\nNone of the dozen have won a major, and neither have the four non-Americans (Fleetwood, Kim Si-woo, Bernd Wiesberger and Hideki Matsuyama).\nHarman, who is bidding to become the first left-hander to win the US Open, knocked in six birdies.\nThe 30-year-old, who won the Wells Fargo tournament last month, said: \"I've been striking the ball so well and giving myself chances so I'll just try to keep doing what I've been doing.\n\"I'll definitely think about the mindset I had in winning Wells Fargo a few weeks ago.\"\nBig-hitting Koepka, who averaged 320 yards with his driver on Saturday, had five birdies in his four-under round.\nRickie Fowler had a run of three successive birdies from the 14th as the leader from the first round shot a four-under 68 to get to 10 under and just two off the lead.\nPatrick Reed's seven-under 65 featured eight birdies and one bogey as he improved to eight under.\nHe said he felt like he \"hit the ball better\" in Friday's second round, despite taking 10 fewer strokes on Saturday.\nReed explained: \"I was really seeing the lines and had the speed. And most of my birdie putts were uphill and I could attack. On Friday it was the opposite.\"\nRussell Henley (67) and Charley Hoffman (68) are all in a group four off the lead on eight under.\nHowever, not all Americans fared well. Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, started the day level par and was still on that mark after a couple of birdies cancelled out two bogeys in his opening 11 holes.\nTwo more bogeys followed though and a double-bogey on the par-five 18th saw him finish four-over after a 76.\n\"It's been an off-week for me with the putting,\" said the former world number one. \"I've been striking the ball well.\n\"It's just been trying to figure it out on and around the greens. And I feel like once the can gets open, I'll start pouring them in.\"\nGermany's Martin Kaymer, winner in 2014, took 41 shots to complete the front nine and although he picked up two birdies on the back nine, his three-over 75 saw him drop back to level par.\nAnd two-time winner Ernie Els, who was two under after round one, dropped five shots in his opening six holes on Saturday. The South African rallied with an eagle two on the par-four 15th but had a triple-bogey seven on the 17th to drop to five over after a 79.\nEngland's Eddie Pepperell, 26, had five birdies and two bogeys in his three-under-par 69 to get to four under and remain in with a chance.\nAfter dropping three shots in his opening six holes, Matt Fitzpatrick holed five birdies in eight holes to post a two-under 70 to climb to three under.\nFellow Englishman Andrew Johnston mixed three birdies with four bogeys as he slipped back to one under with a 73.\nAnd Scotland's Martin Laird is putting together a solid tournament with nine birdies and nine bogeys in his opening three rounds.\nHowever, it looks like Lee Westwood's wait to win a major will go on to The Open in July. The Englishman was three under after round one, but he followed Friday's 75 with another 75 today to drop to three over.\nMore to follow.",

    "document": "The computer program, which is inspired by the human brain, learned how to play 49 classic Atari games. In more than half, it was as good or better than a professional human player.\nResearchers from Google DeepMind said this was the first time a system had learned how to master a wide range of complex tasks.\nThe study is  published in the journal Nature.\nDr Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's vice president of engineering, said:  \"Up until now, self-learning systems have only been used for relatively simple problems.\n\"For the first time, we have used it in a perceptually rich environment to complete tasks that are very challenging to humans.\"\nTechnology companies are investing heavily in machine learning. In 2014, Google purchased DeepMind Technologies for a reported Â£400m.\nThis is not the first time that a machine has mastered complex games.\nIBM's Deep Blue - a chess-playing computer - famously beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in a match staged in 1997.\nHowever, this artificial intelligence system was pre-programmed with a sort of instruction manual that gave it the expertise it needed to excel at the board game.\nThe difference with DeepMind's computer program, which the company describes as an \"agent\", is that it is armed only with the most basic information before it is given a video game to play.\nDr Hassabis explained: \"The only information we gave the system was the raw pixels on the screen and the idea that it had to get a high score. And everything else it had to figure out by itself.\"\nThe team presented the machine with 49 different videogames, ranging from classics such as Space Invaders and Pong, to boxing and tennis games and the 3D-racing challenge Enduro.\nIn 29 of them, it was comparable to or better than a human games tester. For Video Pinball, Boxing and Breakout, its performance far exceeded the professional's, but it struggled with Pac-Man, Private Eye and Montezuma's Revenge.\n\"On the face it, it looks trivial in the sense that these are games from the 80s and you can write solutions to these games quite easily,\" said Dr Hassabis.\n\"What is not trivial is to have one single system that can learn from the pixels, as perceptual inputs, what to do.\n\"The same system can play 49 different games from the box without any pre-programming. You literally give it a new game, a new screen and it figures out after a few hours of game play what to do.\"\nThe research is the latest development in the field of \"deep learning\", which is paving the way for smarter machines.\nScientists are developing computer programs that - like the human brain - can be exposed to large amounts of data, such as images or sounds, and then intuitively extract useful information or patterns.\nExamples include machines that can scan millions of images and understand what they are looking at: they can tell a cat is a cat, for example. This ability is key for self-driving cars, which need an awareness of their surroundings.\nOr machines that can understand human speech, which can be used in sophisticated voice recognition software or for systems that translate languages in real-time.\nDr Hassabis said: \"One of the things holding back robotics today, in factories, in things like elderly care robots and in household-cleaning robots, is that when these machines are in the real world, they have to deal with the unexpected. You can't pre-program it with every eventuality that might happen.\n\"In some sense, these machines need intelligence that is adaptable and they have to be able to learn for themselves.\"\nSome fear that creating computers that can outwit humans could be dangerous.\nIn December, Prof Stephen Hawking said that the development of full artificial intelligence \"could spell the end of the human race\".\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter",

As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness.\nHere are just a few.\nEsther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics.\nShe developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work.\nHer work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award.\nThe British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer.\nHer image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work.\nIda Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics.\nIt was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table.\nShe gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium.\nBut masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre.\nTacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory.\nTacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission.\nLise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two.\nThis laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb.\nAfter moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades.\nBut Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author.\nAnd he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom.\nChien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century.\nShe participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today.\nIn the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head.\nThis landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played.\nAnother neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe.\nShe began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women.\nLeavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth.\nThis led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness.\nThe Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president.\nIt represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke.\nWomen were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation.\nSome say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity.\nIt has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women.\nThat statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.",

    "document": "That's hardly a surprise. These things are never made public.\nRemoving Strachan and his coaches and finding replacements would have meant a serious hit to the coffers of an association that has routinely failed to benefit from the millions of euros on offer to those nations who qualify for major championships.\nMoney was not brought up in the statement, but it's inconceivable that it didn't play a part in the discussion.\nWhy pay when the World Cup campaign is already on life support? Why not accept your fate of another doomed mission, let him see out of his deal, save the cash and make a change if one needs to be made when the group fixtures are completed?\nThe SFA couldn't say any of this. It couldn't say it was unwilling, or unable, to pay off the manager, so a different narrative was delivered in its statement, a narrative of \"jam tomorrow\". In this optimistic view of the world, all that was missing was a complimentary pair of pom-poms.\nAll hope of a play-off spot for the World Cup is not lost, they say. They're clinging to the belief that Scotland can garner enough points from a remaining available total of 18 to force their way into the reckoning when the evidence of everybody's eyes tell us otherwise.\nPresenting a scenario of Scotland reeling off win after win required a fair amount of chutzpah for an association that has watched its team concede seven goals in three winless games. And that on top of two years without a competitive win against anybody other than Malta and Gibraltar.\nStewart Regan, the SFA's chief executive, is quoted on how adamant Strachan is about his team's capacity to make up ground in the group. How? He doesn't say.\nRegan points out that the board is convinced that Strachan still has the \"hunger for the challenge\". Hunger shouldn't have anything to do with it when you've failed to qualify for the most easily accessible Euros in history and then sit fifth out of six in a World Cup qualification group with your dreams going up in a puff of smoke.\nScotland will limp on now until March, when they host Slovenia at Hampden. Will we hear again that Slovenia is not a must-win? Will we see anything different?\nWill any new players be considered? Will there be any thoughts about a new formation? Is there likely to be any acknowledgement that, if Scotland keep doing the same things, they are going to end up with the same results?\nThere was no hint of that in Strachan's words in the SFA statement on Thursday. No acceptance that, if he's staying on, he needs to have a major think about what he is doing, who's he selecting and not selecting.\nIf he had spoken about a new beginning then you might - might - be inclined to buy into it. Is he even thinking about it that way? You would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder. Does Scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1? Can a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder? Maybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of Strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played Ikechi Anya at right-back at Wembley. What happens when Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson are both fit at left-back, along with Lee Wallace and Stephen Kingsley? Is it really one from four there? Does it have to be that way? Where's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene? Aberdeen's Graeme Shinnie, Fulham's Tom Cairney, Brighton's Jamie Murphy, Aston Villa's Ross McCormack, Stoke City's Phil Bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, Middlesbrough's Jordan Rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly. Too often, Strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that Scotland become truly competitive, like Northern Ireland. They have decent Premier League centre-halves - from West Brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from Southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of Championship, League One and Scottish Premiership players, Northern Ireland get the kind of results that are beyond Scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism. It's tantamount to a white flag being raised. A quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what Michael O'Neill is doing with his meagre resources in Belfast.\nThe SFA's statement on Thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of Hampden. When they can't get a draw against Georgia, can't beat Lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like Slovakia, the idea of Scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.",

The government expects growth to continue in double digits - but a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests it will slow to 6.5% in 2013.\nEven the IMF predictions are impressive, however, considering the current global financial climate and the fact that unlike many other countries on the continent, Ethiopia does not have much in the way of natural resources.\nCoffee is one of the biggest export earners in Ethiopia.\nIn Addis Ababa, the country's capital, coffee exporter Michael Girma says it was a challenge to launch his business.\n\"To start up in the export sector, you need to perform with your own cash. Then after that, you can approach the banks,\" he says.\nApart from exporting coffee, he now also owns a cafe, a bar, and a pizzeria, employing 140 people altogether.\nAlthough the business environment is getting very competitive, he is achieving a profit margin of 20-30% each year and feels confident about the future.\n\"A lot has changed in the last seven years,\" he says. \"You need to be aggressive, but not arrogant.\"\nAlthough foreign investors are encouraged, many sectors are reserved for domestic investors.\n\"The restricted sectors are those which supply to the local people. If foreign investors want to come in and invest in projects which are export oriented, anything is open,\" he says. \"It would be very hard to compete otherwise.\"\nDespite annual high inflation, some investors think the potential in Africa's second most populous nation has not been recognised.\nEarlier this year, Shultze Global Investments launched a $100m equity fund aiming to invest in Ethiopian businesses.\nIn a nondescript building on a hillside overlooking Addis Ababa, Berhane Demissie decides where to put that money.\n\"Ethiopia offers significant opportunities for investors,\" she says, pointing out that agriculture is a strong growth sector.\n\"Anything grows in Ethiopia with the various climate and soil diversities that we have. That also follows through to the agricultural value-added chain with processing and exports,\" Ms Demissie says.\nWith 85% of the population dependent on the agricultural sector, she says the government is trying to ensure those farmers have access to finance and fertilisers that will allow them to grow more.\nMs Demissie says this will lift people out of poverty.\n\"If the programme was just about big farms I would have said no, but the smallholder farmers are being included in the overall growth of the economy,\" she says.\nShe also says there is a lot more demand for consumer goods and services within the country, but too few manufacturing companies.\nIn 2010, Transparency International, which rates countries according to perceived corruption, listed Ethiopia at 120th out of 183 countries and the Washington-based Global Financial Integrity research organisation concluded that illicit financial outflows between 2000 and 2009 totalled $11.7bn (Â£7.4bn) in 2009  - which was more than Ethiopia had earned through exports.\nIt is reports like those which deter some of the diaspora from returning to the country to look for business opportunities.\nBerhanu Nega went back to Addis Ababa in 1994 after the change in government and was elected mayor in 2005 - only to find himself imprisoned for life on the day he was elected on charges of treason, because he had called for the overthrow of the president.\nHe was released after 21 months and returned to the US where he is now an economics professor at Bucknell University. He is also the co-founder of Ginbot 7, an Ethiopian opposition party, and he does not believe the country is a good place to invest in for the medium or long term.\n\"If you want to make big bucks and get out then it is good for the short term,\" he says.\nApart from concerns about corruption, he is also worried about the uncertainty of inflation: \"The government has been printing money since 2005 and inflation, depending on which figures you look at, ranges between 40-60%.\"\nHe says many businesses have closed down because of the taxation the government has imposed to pay for its expanded security forces.\nHe adds: \"The government has been pushing tens of thousands of people off their lands because of the land grabs by China, Saudi Arabia and India among others, which has caused serious conflict in many areas.\"\nHe does not feel there will be any changes soon and is pessimistic about the country's future business environment.",

    "document": "But the latest Cinderella is bucking the trend - and seemingly appealing to audiences as a result.\nDirected by Sir Kenneth Branagh, Cinderella is a live-action version of Disney's classic 1950 animation that has taken $70m (Â£43.1m) on its opening weekend in the United States.\nYet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending.\nBritish actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother.\n\"Keeping it classic is the twist,\" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V.\n\"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015.\n\"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price.\n\"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think.\n\"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.\"\nHelena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious \"as to whether a straight version would work\".\n\"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'\n\"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\"\nJust as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\".\nBut James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\".\n\"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.\n\"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\"\nThis is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says.\n\"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.\n\"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\"\nJames has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\".\nCate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.\n\"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\"\nBranagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.\n\"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.\n\"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.\n\"And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring.\"\nCinderella is out in the UK on 27 March.",

    "document": "Mr King is not the rather better-known writer of horror novels (though his robust opinions on the dangers of monetary largesse can tend towards sleepless nights).\nThis Mr King is senior economic adviser at HSBC. And a China expert.\nWriting about the country's economic slowdown in 2012, he said: \"China's debt fuelled expansion was never likely to be sustainable.\"\nThe amber warning lights came back on this morning when the ratings agency Moody's downgraded China's credit rating, its investor benchmark for analysing the country's economic performance.\nNow, the rating is still A1 - the agency's fifth highest - but nevertheless does highlight growing concerns about the amount of debt the world's most populous country is carrying.\nThe problem is not the government's direct debt, which at less than 40% of GDP is modest by Western standards, or the eminently manageable 3% deficit (the rate at which that debt is rising).\nThe issue is the debt being carried by the country's companies, or more specifically the \"state-owned enterprises\" (SOEs) that constitute the grumbling and sometimes out-of-date engines of the Chinese economy.\nAnd the debts being carried by the country's local governments - which, of course, in a state the size of China, are a little more significant than those of an English town council, say.\nHere, the picture is different.\nSOE debt stands at 115% of GDP, a figure that is steadily rising and is far higher than, say, comparable figures for Japan and South Korea (where comparable debts are around 30%).\nMoody's estimates that bringing the leverage of those firms down to more manageable levels would cost more than $400bn (£308bn).\nAt the same time, China's own finance ministry has warned that some local authorities are struggling to meet day-to-day operating costs, as they find themselves caught between supporting often inefficient local businesses - making steel, for example - or funding the unpaid debts and unemployment costs associated with shutting down or reforming the mainstays of regional economies.\nNow, China certainly has deep pockets.\nIts foreign currency reserves stand at more than $3tn and its annual current account surplus is $200bn.\nSo, debt sustainability is not a near and present danger.\nBut, if the old joke is that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, when it comes to China, it only has to think about reaching for its handkerchief and the global economy can suffer a fit of the vapours.\nWhen China announced weaker-than-expected economic data at the beginning of 2016, world stock markets went into free fall and commodity prices tumbled.\nIn 2010, average Chinese growth hovered around 10%. It is now between 6% and 7%.\nMore manageable than the heady days of seven years ago, yes, but there are fears that a lack of economic reform could see growth fall to 5% as President Xi Jinping balances the drive for a more efficient economy (with all the dislocating restructuring costs and possible job losses that could incur) with the need to keep political tension to a minimum.\nIn a jittery world, China's debt mountain can loom larger than the fundamentals suggest.\nAnd Moody's downgrade is just one straw in the wind.\nAsian stock markets hardly paused for breath when it was announced earlier this morning and warnings of a \"hard landing\" for the Chinese economy have been oft-predicted and not materialised.\nBut, Chinese bond yields are rising as investors demand a higher risk premium for funding the government's liabilities.\nThere is no need to rush for the lifeboats yet.\nHowever, it's probably worth knowing where they are.",

    "document": "While $50m is the starting point for serious wealth, \"in reality your spending power and investing power really gets to the next level when you get to around $100m\", says Catherine Tillotson.\nMs Tillotson is joint managing partner of Scorpio Partnership, a London-based firm which advises the super-rich on how to manage their assets, and she says there is a reason for this dividing line between the wealthy elite and the rest of us.\n\"This is the point at which families will start to think about employing people purely to help them manage their financial affairs,\" she says.\nThere may now be more multi-millionaires and billionaires than ever before in the world, but since the 2008 global financial crisis the wealth gap between the world's top 1% and the rest of us has grown.\nThis increasingly stark division between haves and have-nots is leading to increasing rancour towards the very wealthy, say many social commentators.\nRobert Kuhn is better placed than many to understand this hostility - a former investment banker and corporate strategist, he is himself among the world's wealthy elite.\nThe world is getting wealthier - we live longer, eat better, are better educated and fewer people live in extreme poverty.\nBut with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, the BBC is investigating the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015.\nA Richer World 2015\n\"I think much of it is justified,\" he says, perhaps surprisingly, \"and I think we should describe why that's the case.\"\nOne of the main reasons for this, he says, is the web. \"We have a very highly wired world with the internet, people are more aware of things - and I think that's a good thing.\"\nMr Kuhn is coy about his own net worth. When asked if it is \"tens of millions\" of dollars, he replies, \"I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said.\"\nTrained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm \"at the right time\".\nHe says he worked hard, \"but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself\".\nHe wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation.\n\"That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility.\"\nBut given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many.\nIn the 1980s, the richest 10% had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10% in the average industrialised country.\nNow, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states.\nIn Denmark the top 10% earn about five times more than the bottom 10% - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much.\nHow much more do the top 10% earn than the bottom 10%?\nSource: OECD (2011)\nOther organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by 2016.\n\"This is something that we should be very worried about,\" says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs.\nIf countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD.\nThis goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else.\nBut, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. \"Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth,\" Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme.\nAn increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD.\nPoorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education.\nAnd that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research.\nIt is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too.\nAlex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour.\nTen will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself.\n\"Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to,\" says Mr Cheatle.\n\"There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30% a year.\"\nWhen you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising.\nOver the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1% spend a staggering $45bn (£30bn) on travel and hospitality, $40bn (£26bn) on cars, and $25bn (£16bn) each on art, jewellery and watches.\nOr course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two.\nThe world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m (590ft) long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to $600m (£400m) - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others.\nSource: Boat International\nSo with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help?\nRobert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit.\nHe believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would \"inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society\".\n\"I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth,\" says Mr Kuhn.\nAt Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes.\n\"The tax question is hugely complicated,\" she says.\n\"Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules.\"\nHowever, \"in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system\", she says.\nYet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies.\nProtest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide.\nFor his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but \"it matters in social stability for sure\", he agrees.\n\"It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations.\"\n\"To me that's the biggest problem, for any country,\" he says. \"And many countries are facing that.\"\nClick here for more from BBC's A Richer World, a season exploring the world's wealth, poverty and inequality",

The Chinese-owned firm aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025.\nMazda also plans to introduce electric technology in its cars from 2019.\nIn theory, a compression-ignition petrol engine should have big advantages.  But it isn't easy to make technology work - and some of the biggest companies, including General Motors, have already tried.\nSo why should a relatively small Japanese manufacturer like Mazda succeed? Well, partly because - unlike the really big players - it isn't afraid to take risks. It has done in the past.\nIt's the only mainstream manufacturer, for example, which has persisted with rotary engines in its cars. Like compression ignition motors, they have theoretical benefits, but create complex engineering challenges.\nMazda's rotary has had some success. The company won the Le Mans 24 Hours race with it in 1991, and the latest version was fitted in its RX-8 sportscar. Popular with drivers, it was sadly unreliable.\nIf the new motor is to be a success, it needs to be reliable as well as efficient. And Mazda needs to be able to persuade regulators that petrol engines still have a strong future.\nIt may prove to be the perfect stop-gap, as electric cars are developed and charging infrastructure is created.\nOr it may turn out to be a brilliant idea, which has come to fruition just a few years too late.",

    "document": "Prof Les Mayhew said the difference between the sexes peaked at nearly six years in the 1970s.\nLife expectancy is going up all round, but the rates for men are increasing faster.\nPlummeting smoking rates in men are thought to explain a lot of the change.\nProf Mayhew, a professor of statistics at Cass Business School, analysed life expectancy data in England and Wales. He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live.\nHis findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030.\nHe said: \"What's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy.\"\nThe reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. \"One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80% of males smoked.\n\"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years.\"\nOther factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago.\nBy contrast, women started smoking later than men.  \n, but are falling fast in men.\nA boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents.\nIt means that women could still have the edge for some time to come.\nProf David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage.\"\nHowever, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries.\nCountries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which \"are not picky about men and women\", he said.\nIn countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, \"there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors\".\nAt one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an \"absolutely massive\" difference in a \"very gendered society\".\nIn his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow.\nHe said: \"Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies.\"",

An austerity that has ended up disheartening the people\".\nWhen European Union leaders meet on Tuesday he would \"reaffirm that the priority is growth, jobs and investment\", he said.\nMatthew Price, BBC News, Brussels\nEurope has not \"voted against the EU\". The vast majority of those who bothered to cast a ballot did so for parties that are pro-EU, and they will make up the majority in the new parliament.\nYes, the focus is understandably on France and the UK, with Denmark, Greece, and others also giving Euro-enthusiasts cause for concern. However in many countries mainstream parties dominated - in Germany, Italy, Poland where it was felt a growing Eurosceptic movement could break through, in the Netherlands and elsewhere.\nSo the results do not constitute a \"problem\" as such for the leaders of the EU. Many leaders will point this out around the dinner table tonight. Others, however, will stress that a sizeable chunk of voters chose parties that want \"Brussels\" to change, and that the EU needs to address this issue if it is to maintain popular support and legitimacy in the longer term.\nAhead of this election most leaders were not planning to come to Brussels to discuss how to reset their country's relationship with the EU. David Cameron was of course - but others were not. Will others - under domestic pressure - now join him?\nAnti-EU forces overshadow Brussels talks\nMrs Merkel - whose conservative Christian Democratic Union won a comfortable 35% of the vote in Germany - said it was now up to the established parties of Europe to win voters back by focusing on \"improving competitiveness, on growth and creating jobs\".\n\"This is the best answer to the disappointed people who voted in a way we didn't wish for,\" she said.\nElsewhere in Europe, the anti-EU UKIP was celebrating winning 27% of the vote, marking the first time in a century that a party other than the Conservatives or Labour has won any UK election.\nPrime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative party lost seven seats, said it was clear voters were \"deeply disillusioned\" with Europe and that the message was \"received and understood\".\nBut he insisted he would neither bring forward the date of an in/out referendum on UK withdrawal from the EU - scheduled for 2017 - nor seek a pact with UKIP.\nDespite the unprecedented Eurosceptic gains across the Union, Jose Manuel Barroso, outgoing president of the European Commission, insisted that the pro-EU blocs still had \"a very solid and workable majority\".\nThe centre-right European People's Party appears set to win 213 out of the 751 seats, with 28.36% across the bloc, according to estimated results issued by the European Parliament. That would mean it remains the biggest group - but with more than 60 seats fewer than before.\nThe Socialist alliance has a projected 190 seats, with 25.3% of the vote, the Liberals 9% and the Greens 7%.\nThe Eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group appeared to have around 38 seats - including the 24 for UKIP. But the number of non-attached right-wing MEPs is set to rise, boosting the Eurosceptic camp.\nMr Barroso said a \"truly democratic debate\" was needed to address the concerns of those who did not vote, or \"voted in protest\".\nTurnout across Europe is estimated at 43.1%, the first time it has not fallen since the previous election - but it has only increased by 0.1%.\nResult highlights (from European Parliament website):\nThe election is the biggest exercise in multi-national democracy in the world, affecting the lives of the EU's 500 million citizens.\nThe parliament's powers have expanded since the last election in 2009, and it is hoping to have a decisive say in who gets the EU's top job, president of the European Commission.\nYou can follow full coverage with all the latest updates at bbc.co.uk/vote2014.",

    "document": "It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"",

I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today.\n\"The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"It is not good enough. I pick the team, I pick the shape, I will take 90% of the blame for that but the players need to stand up as well.\"\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We went in 1-0 at half-time without playing particularly well but looked a threat. We looked comfortable enough and then after the sending-off, we were ruthless. We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more.\n\"The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent.\n\"It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game.\n\"There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away.

    "document": "Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club:\n\"I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session.\n\"The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse. The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.\n\"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times.\n\"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there.\n\"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\n\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\n\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\n\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\n\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\n\"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\n\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\n\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\n\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\n\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.\n\"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.\n\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.\n\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\n\"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\"\nAlex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.\nThe Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday.

He took no part, I state this again - no part - in the blackmail or blackmail attempts.\"\n\"Karim Benzema will show he acted in good faith, and I hope this will be seen as soon as possible,\" Mr Cormier added.\nWhether or not the footballer is charged, correspondents say the formal investigation exposes him to a lengthy period of doubt ahead of the Euro 2016 tournament that France hosts next year.\nFrench coach Deschamps refused to comment on the legal case on Thursday but said Mr Benzema had been injured.\nHe added that Lyon midfielder Mr Valbuena was not in an emotional state to play in upcoming games against Germany and England.\nKarim Benzema is the top scorer in the France team, so doubts about his participation at Euro 2016 represent a cloud over Les Bleus as they aim to make the most of their host status.\nThe Real Madrid striker has scored 27 goals in 81 appearances for his country, more than double the number scored by fellow France striker Olivier Giroud, and apart from missing out at the 2010 World Cup, has been a mainstay in the team since making his debut in 2007.\nBenzema is regarded as one of Europe's top strikers, but despite winning honours at Real Madrid, he is yet to make a telling contribution at a major tournament for his country.\nSources have told French media that a relative of Mr Benzema was contacted by the blackmailers, in an attempt to involve him in the scheme against his team-mate. There has been no confirmation from police.\nThree other men have been placed under formal investigation after Mr Valbuena was contacted by someone claiming to have the video.\nIt is not the first time Mr Benzema has been involved in a police inquiry.

    "document": "The keynote MacTaggart Lecture will be given by the director general of the BBC, Mark Thompson, at what is a crucial time for the corporation.\nLast year during the keynote Edinburgh speech, one of the BBC's biggest competitors, James Murdoch, launched an outspoken attack on the corporation.\nHe called its \"dominant\" scale \"chilling\" and said that it should be \"far, far smaller\".\nThe BSkyB chairman - who also runs much of News Corporation, the publisher of The Times, Sunday Times, Sun and the News of the World - expressed particular concern over the public funding of the BBC's news output, which he called \"state-sponsored journalism\".\nHe claimed it was a \"threat to the plurality and independence of news provision\", because it made it hard for commercial publishers to earn money from their own news websites.\nTo some of his audience, the idea of \"state-sponsored journalism\" was over the top.\nBut, worryingly for the BBC, Murdoch's general point that the corporation was too big and was harming its commercial rivals, drew murmurs of agreement from other media owners and politicians.\nSince then, the BBC has found itself under almost constant fire, not least in the newspapers which now compete with it, as they extend their businesses onto the internet.\nIn this year's MacTaggart Lecture, Mr Thompson must try to win round the corporation's critics, including some of those commercial rivals and politicians.\nBut he must also set out his vision for the BBC, as a publicly-funded news and cultural organisation in a world of rapidly changing technology and behaviour - and tighter public finances.\nThe BBC has been widely criticised for the large sums of licence fee money it pays to its stars and top managers.\nIn the new age of public austerity, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt says much needs changing at the BBC.\nHe has given notice that the next licence fee negotiations - when they begin in a year's time - will be very tough.\nViewers, he says, can expect to pay less.\nBelatedly, the BBC has responded to some of the criticisms.\nSenior executives' pay has been published, then frozen, and bonuses withdrawn.\nThe highest-paid managers are giving up a month's pay for the next two years and will be asked to withdraw from a scheme which tops up their pensions.\nThe BBC is to publish the names of its highest-paid presenters and performers and it has proposed radical cuts to its staff pension scheme, to cope with a large deficit.\nBut that in turn has alienated many BBC employees, who are less highly paid.\nUnions are balloting their members for strike action.\nOther staff are unhappy because their jobs are moving to the north of England, while executives leading the move are keeping their own homes in the south.\nMark Thompson must address all of these different concerns and audiences.\nYet he is also expected to point out that the BBC has much to be proud of.\nIt still has high support from the public, and large and appreciative audiences for its television, radio and online services.\nInnovations such as the BBC website and iPlayer have added to the public benefit provided by the corporation in recent years.\nWhen, asked to make cuts, it tries to close a service such as the digital radio station 6 Music, there is an outcry.\nOn the eve of Mr Thompson's speech, the case for the BBC has been eloquently argued by two academics in what they call An Appeal to the New Parliament in Defence of a British Institution.\nProfessor Steven Barnett and Professor Jean Seaton, of the University of Westminster, call on Parliament to remember \"the huge affection in which the BBC is held by the British public, the worldwide admiration which it attracts, and the immeasurable importance of the democratic and cultural contribution which it makes to British life\".\nThe BBC director general could hardly put it better himself. Whether he does so remains to be seen.",

    "document": "On board were 200 men and women from the United States intent on building a colony on the Caribbean island.\nThey hoped that if enough of their fellow nationals followed their lead, eventually Cuba would be annexed by the US.\nLocal folklore has it that after days fighting a path through the swamp, the early settlers were so happy to reach somewhere that was not knee-deep in mud or thick with swarms of mosquitoes that they proclaimed it to be \"the glory\".\nLa Gloria City was born.\nIn fact, they had been sold a lie.\nThey had bought plots of land in a town that existed only in the blueprints of the Cuba Land and Steamship Company of New York.\nUpon realising the deception, many cut their losses and went home.\nThe hardy ones stayed on and became citrus farmers, sugarcane growers and cattle farmers.\nThe sweltering humidity is still the same as in those days.\nBut all that remains of those early 20th Century pioneers today are the gravestones in the local cemetery.\nThey include a store owner called William Stokes, who was just a baby when his parents chose to make the trip to Cuba.\nHe married, raised a family and stayed in the sleepy community for the rest of his life, even after his children left and his business went broke.\nBy the time of his death in 1974, Mr Stokes was the only original US settler still on the island, earning him the title of \"the last North American in Cuba\".\n\"It's important to me to maintain this place,\" says gravedigger Jorge Gallardo as he leads me to the grave of Willy Stokes, as he calls him.\nMr Gallardo has spent a year hacking back the encroaching vegetation from the cemetery.\n\"This is our eternal home - for me and my children, and for our North American founders,\" he explains.\nOne of La Gloria's oldest residents remembers when it was more of an American than a Cuban town.\nNow in her late 80s, Jeanny Martinez was fostered by William Stokes' parents and still speaks near-flawless English.\n\"La Gloria was all American. Beautiful, American houses. The Methodist church was there and the Episcopal one was over there,\" she says pointing from the porch of her small tin-and-timber home.\nLike many Cubans of her generation, Ms Martinez speaks of her youth before the 1959 revolution with a mixture of romanticism and nostalgia.\n\"I have to defend the Americans because lots of people were hungry and they gave them work and food in the orange and tangerine groves,\" she says.\n\"Now La Gloria is not good for anything.\"\nThat is not a view shared by those working at the local farming cooperative named after revolutionary hero Camilo Cienfuegos.\nUnder more relaxed rules on agricultural production in Cuba, the cooperative has begun to grow a wider range of goods on land that previously lay idle.\n\"Yucca, bananas, avocados, squashes, tomatoes...,\"Elida Diaz lists the things which grow on the land she farms with her family.\nMs Diaz disputes the idea that the town has stagnated over the years saying that the region has developed significantly.\n\"When I arrived here aged 20, there was no electricity, nothing,\" she recalls.\n\"Today we have public transport, we're on the electrical grid, we have refrigeration units. It's been a complete change.\"\nBut in the field behind her, the men are mostly using the same tools as the settlers did: hoes, machetes, their bare hands.\nA loyal revolutionary, Ms Diaz is reluctant to voice criticism but admits that more is needed if the remote community is to prosper and move into the 21st Century.\nA water shortage is causing severe problems throughout Camaguey province and monthly incomes for rural workers are far from stable.\n\"A new tractor would let us work the land better, new tools, boots for the workers, tractor tyres, spare parts, fuelâ€¦\" she says, warming to her theme.\nBut she is quick to identify Washington and its decades-old trade embargo as the source of the problem.\n\"The first thing that the Americans must do is lift the embargo on us. Then we could supply them with our citrus and they could send us the products we need. That would be wonderful.\"\nIn 1932 a huge hurricane swept through Camaguey devastating the citrus and sugar crops and destroying the dreams of the thousand or so colonists in La Gloria City.\nMost sold up and left.\nAmong the wreckage was the town's Protestant church.\nMore than 80 years later, the groundwork for a new one is only now getting underway.\nBuilt on the original site with funding from Jacksonville, Florida, churchgoers in La Gloria see it as a fitting legacy to this uniquely American corner of the Cuban countryside.",

    "document": "\"Stalled,\" she said, before challenging anyone in the room to name a significant change that had taken place in the last two years.\nSo is she right? Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt?\nThe answer depends on how narrowly you define reform. When she speaks, Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics.\nThe pace of political change has certainly slowed.  In part that's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein's presidency.\nIn the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don't upset the army.\nPolitical prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations.\nIn a short period of time, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible.\nStories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events.\nBut the early pace of those changes hasn't been sustained. There was no way it could.\nSo did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge.\nMs Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged.\nDrafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution.\nThis is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\".\nThe opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most.\nThey are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes.\nMuch of Ms Suu Kyi's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012, and thus legitimised, is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition.\nJust as it would in mature democracies, responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees.\nWith each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw, they've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results.\nAltering the \"Suu Kyi clause\" has been dismissed outright (as a threat to national sovereignty), while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament, though if the army remains opposed there's no way it can be changed.\nMs Suu Kyi's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders.\nLooming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year. What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president?\nThough the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled, that's not to say there haven't been other important developments.  It's just that they don't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi.\nEver since independence in 1948, Myanmar has never been truly at peace, with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state.\nThe last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement. All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process, attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future.\nFor President Thein Sein, a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what's likely to be his only term in office. Unfortunately for him, with a deal within reach, the number of clashes has begun to increase once more.\nOutside politics, particularly in the big cities, people's lives are changing fast.\nThanks to new laws and regulations, Myanmar's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world. GDP growth is rapid, though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind.\nOn Myanmar's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market.\nAfter years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite, there's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information. In itself that's a game-changer.\nSo is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty?  It rather depends who you are, and what you're drinking.",

    "document": "Instead of fees rising to £9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything.\nIt's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to £6,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one.\nThis is Labour going for an all-or-nothing approach - asserting free education as a fundamental principle - and creating the starkest choice in university policy for two decades.\nIt's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour.\nIt makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt.\nLabour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth £11.2bn per year.\nAnd this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further £500m per year.\nThis would be covered by the £48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments.\nBut there are lower estimates.\nLabour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students.\nBut the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around £7.5bn to £8bn.\nLabour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction.\nBut they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments.\nThe most recent figures show £76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years.\nFrom this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the £10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%.\nAnd the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors.\nUnder Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government.\nBut is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged?\nUniversities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion.\nOne of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates.\nThe argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees.\nThis year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased.\nBut the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration.\nAlthough wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest.\nDo students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects?\nDepartment for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned £10,000 per year more.\nAmong younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at £6,000 per year.\nBut the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade.\nLabour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters.\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections.\nThe survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote.\nThe Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives.\nIs this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government?\nCould they really entirely scrap fees?\nThere will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees.\nGermany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees.\nFrench undergraduates can study for low fees.\nIn the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about £100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.\nThere are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.\nAnd the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland.\nFor England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.",

We've learnt not to question [the government's] ambition too much because they've quite often exceeded what we thought was possible,\" he said.\nBut Ethiopia, like tiny nearby Rwanda, poses some difficult questions for democratic countries with good intentions.\nBoth nations have achieved remarkable economic growth in the context of an often highly repressive form of governance.\nCritics accuse donors of quietly ignoring human rights abuses, or even of indirectly sustaining them.\nMr Conway acknowledged there were a lot of \"hard arguments\" with Ethiopia's government, and \"there are policies we don't support, and won't\".\nBut he praised a bilateral partnership that \"is really quite effective\".\nThe clear hope, on both sides, is that with the right, sustainable, projects Ethiopia can wean itself off foreign aid within the foreseeable future.\nNear the small hillside village of Bahari Hatsra just outside Korem, we found 40-year-old Admassie Mekonen walking home with a simple wooden plough on his shoulder, after a day's work on the small field he rents.\nFor the past four years he, his wife and 10-year-old daughter have benefited from a partly British-funded programme that pays Mr Admassie a monthly wage of about Â£20 ($31) during the six-month \"food gap\" season before harvest, when the family has exhausted its supplies.\nIn return, he works on a variety of public projects, chosen by the community - terracing the hillsides, for example, to prevent soil erosion.\nThe programme is a part of a recent shift away from giving foreign aid money to support individual governments, and instead to put it directly in the hands of the poor.\n\"It's hundreds of thousands of man-hours every year... it's restored the landscape,\" said Mr Conway.\nBut the challenges ahead remain significant.\nEthiopia's population is heading towards 100 million, with a quarter still living in extreme poverty.\nSitting down in front of his simple wood and mud home, Mr Admassie said the cash payments had, at times, saved his family from starvation. But he questioned whether he would ever be able to manage without them.\n\"I don't own any land. I rent my fields. I have to give half the crop to the owner as payment.\n\"I can work hard now, but I worry about what will happen when I get older. I will have to go to the city to find work,\" he said.",

Clearly nothing good comes out of that kind of situation, but sadly it's a reflection of the state of our football.\"\nInstability in the coaching role has led to the NFF appointing six managers since 2010 - Shaibu Amodu, Lars Lagerbäck, Austin Eguavoen, Samson Siasia, Stephen Keshi and Sunday Oliseh.\nOdegbami insists there needs to be consistency in the coaching department, but warns that only competent administrators can stop the Nigerian game from drowning in mediocrity.\n\"Until the foundation is strengthened and properly reinforced everything that you build on it will collapse the way it has this time around,\" he said.\n\"Yes it [poor results on the pitch] has everything to do with the way the coaches have been shuffled like musical game of chairs.\n\"Now the NFF president has said he wants a foreign coach but who are the foreign coach that will come here?\n\"These are all journeymen. The top coaches will not come to Nigeria - they will just come, milk the country, live in Europe, collect big money and will not do anything.\n\"We are in a big mess created by the NFF board and I don't know how we are going to come out of this with the 2018 World Cup coming soon. It's a failure on the part of the administrators.\n\"Unfortunately we are no longer one of Africa's football powerhouses. If we do not qualify for the Nations Cup two times in a row, how do you call yourself a giant?\"\n'Nigerian heroes abused by administrators'\nAnother former international Taribo West, who played in two World Cups and won Olympic Gold in 1996, believes Nigerian football lacks an impartial football body.\nThe former Inter Milan, AC Milan and Derby County defender feels the NFF has seemed intent on destroying the reputation of Nigerian football, along with their own.\n\"Those managing football have disrespected our coaches and players,\" Taribo told BBC Sport.\n\"Look at how dedicated heroes like Siasia, Keshi and Oliseh were treated by the administrators - they were unpaid and abused by those in power.\n\"The problems we are facing now started a long time ago and the slide will continue with these sets of politicians and self-serving people in charge of our football.\n\"Where's the structure for development in our football? The only thing we hear daily are those fighting for power and control of the game.\n\"They lack the technical ability to reshape the country's football and that is the sad truth.\"\nThe amount of dissenting voices suggests something drastic needs to be done to change Nigerian football.\nNFF president Amaju Pinnick says he wants quickly to move on by shifting focus to the 2018 World Cup, while at the same time insisting his administration does not suffer from poor organisation, bad management nor administrative deficiencies.\nSince taking charge of the NFF in September 2014, Pinnick has reiterated his desire to change the way Nigerian football is run.\nBut he has yet to deliver on good intentions and it is time for promises to be delivered.\nFor Nigerian football to move forward, it must find a way to forge an environment that looks after its players, coaches, develop football from the grassroots and has transparent and fair administration.",

    "document": "The project will examine hair, bone and other material from a collection amassed by a Swiss biologist - and will invite submissions from elsewhere.\nMany cultures relate legends of hairy, humanoid creatures that lurk in the wilds, rarely seen.\nBut material claimed to be from such creatures have never been subjected to modern scientific techniques.\n\"It's an area that any serious academic ventures into with a deal of trepidation... It's full of eccentric and downright misleading reports,\" said Prof Bryan Sykes, from Oxford University.\nThe researchers will apply a systematic approach and employ the latest advances in genetic testing, aiming to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\"There have been DNA tests done on alleged yetis and other such things but since then the testing techniques, particularly on hair, have improved a lot due to advances in forensic science,\" the Oxford geneticist told Reuters news agency.\nModern testing could get valid results from a fragment of a shaft of hair, added Prof Sykes, who is leading the project with Michel Sartori, director of the Lausanne Museum of Zoology.\nA 1951 expedition to Mount Everest famously returned with photographs of giant footprints in the snow, fuelling speculation about giant Himalayan creatures, unknown to science.\nSince then, many eye-witness reports of such creatures have emerged from remote regions of the world.\nThese humanoid beasties are variously known as the \"yeti\" or \"migoi\" in the Himalayas, \"bigfoot\" or \"sasquatch\" in North America, \"almasty\" in the Caucasus mountains and \"orang pendek\" in Sumatra, but there are many others.\nTests up to now have usually concluded that alleged yeti remains were in fact human. But, said Prof Sykes, \"there has been no systematic review of this material.\"\nThe project will focus on an archive of remains held at the Lausanne museum that was assembled by Bernard Heuvelmans, a Belgian-French biologist who investigated reported yeti sightings from 1950 up to his death in 2001.\nOther institutions and individuals will also be asked to send in details of any possible yeti material.\nAside from the yeti question, Prof Sykes said he hoped the project would add to the growing body of knowledge on the interaction between different human species in the past.\n\"In the last two years it has become clear that there was considerable interbreeding between  \n          Homo sapiens and Neanderthals ... about 2% to 4% of the DNA of each individual European is Neanderthal,\" he said.\nThose who are favourable to the idea of as-yet undescribed creatures say the yeti and orang pendek could represent survivals of  \n          Homo erectus,  \n          Homo floresiensis (the Indonesian \"Hobbit\") or  \n          Gigantopithecus - a giant ape that once inhabited the forests of East Asia. The idea has even spawned the term \"cryptozoology\" to describe the search for such beasts.\nOthers are highly sceptical of such tales, and consider the subject unworthy of serious scientific investigation.\nAsked about the project's chances of success, Prof Sykes said: \"The answer is, of course, I don't know,\" adding, \"it's unlikely, but on the other hand if we don't examine it we won't know.\"",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nBelgium, ranked second in the world, are the next test for Chris Coleman's side as they look to continue their remarkable progress in France.\nLegendary Wales strikers Dean Saunders and John Hartson, who between them won 126 caps and scored 36 goals for their country, explain how Wales can win and book a place in the semi-finals.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSaunders: Belgium are going to dominate possession, which is fine, but we have got to stop them from hurting us - that is difficult because they have so many different weapons in their attack.\nWe will have to close down Kevin de Bruyne, who has been playing behind Romelu Lukaku and has got a stinging shot in him on either foot, but if Eden Hazard is fit then he will be Belgium's most dangerous player.\nWhen we beat Belgium in Cardiff in June, Coleman kept Hazard quiet by bringing in Jazz Richards at right wing-back and moving Chris Gunter infield to be the right-sided centre-half in our back three.\nBetween them, they handled him really well down Belgium's left, but I don't see Chris doing the same this time because continuity has been a big part of why we have done so well in France, especially at the back where we have been unchanged in all four games.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI can see Chris sticking with the same team that started against Northern Ireland, but our right-sided defensive midfielder - either Joe Allen or Joe Ledley - will have to get across to help Gunter as soon as Hazard gets the ball, along with James Chester, the right-sided centre-half.\nTheir job will be to stop Hazard from coming inside and to show him down the line instead. When that happens, Gunter will also try to stop the cross from coming in, but you have to be realistic - Hazard is so good, he is going to get some balls over.\nSo all our midfield players will have to pick their runners up around the box, not just De Bruyne, and the most important thing will be to mark Lukaku tightly because he will be trying to get between our other two centre-halves when the cross comes in.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSaunders: When we clear those crosses, we have got to counter-attack like I know we can do, because while Hazard's attacking play is one of Belgium's strengths, it is also a weakness.\nJan Vertonghen's injury means we do not know who will play as Belgium's left-back against Wales but, whoever it is, we will be able to isolate them because Hazard does not run back.\nHungary did it effectively, and they do not have the same attacking threat as us.\nThe mistake they made was leaving their wide players too far up the pitch and that allowed Hazard to hurt them more - he was on fire in that game and Belgium should have won by more than 4-0.\nAfter watching that game again on Wednesday, though, I now have a clearer picture of what Wales will have to do to win.\nThere is no way we will be as open as Hungary were from the start because we have so many unselfish and disciplined players like Allen and Ledley who do a lot of running just to support our defenders and ensure we do not lose our shape.\nBut, when we steal the ball back, we have to use it properly. That starts with the first header clear from one of those Hazard crosses.\nI would be telling Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey to drift over to Belgium's left where they will have space - and the aim should be to get the ball to them and build the attack from there.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHartson: There is a decision to be made up front because Hal Robson-Kanu played in both games against Belgium in the qualifiers and did not let us down.\nHal is very mobile and gives us a threat in behind their defence with his pace, and he can also carry the ball better than Sam Vokes can.\nSam is a big centre-forward that you can hit the ball to, and he will keep hold of it. He has a similar role to the one I had up front for Wales - winning headers and winning fouls so the team can advance up the pitch.\nIt depends which way Chris wants to go, but Sam has started the past two games and I don't think he has done an awful lot wrong.\nHe will contain both of Belgium's centre-halves like he did against Russia and give them problems in the air and on the ground - you cannot get around him.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSam missed a good chance against Northern Ireland but the next one he gets like that, he will put it away. I have worked with him and I know how good he is.\nI also think he will now be feeling like the Wales number nine, not a bit-part player, which is something else I can relate to.\nAt first I was always behind Ian Rush, Mark Hughes and Dean Saunders, but when Hughes became manager he made me first choice and my confidence went through the roof.\nI took on the mantle of being the main striker and I think Sam is in that position now, as an important member of this team.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHartson: Coleman has got pretty much every tactical and selection issue right at this tournament so far but we have to appreciate how good this Belgium team is and what an incredible victory this would be.\nFor it to happen, we need to have total focus at the back and we will rely on our best two players again - Ramsey and Bale, who have been involved in every Wales goal at this tournament - if we are going to score.\nI am optimistic we can get through, but I would not say I was overly confident about it because watching Belgium the other night was frightening, even if it was only against Hungary.\nOne big factor in our favour is that we are unbeaten in our past three meetings, including a win - so we do know how to get a result against them.\nSaunders: Belgium are favourites for a reason but we have a good record against them, even going back to when I was in the team.\nWales have a winning formula and Bale is part of that. He is a proper match-winner and, for me, the best player in the tournament. With him in the team, anything is possible.\nPick the XI that you think can take Wales far at Euro 2016 - and then share it with your friends using our team selector.",

She said she would be back tomorrow.\n\"He suddenly just said 'I love you so much',\" she remembers.\n\"I said 'Yes, of course. I love you too'.\"\nBut when she got home, she received a call from the hospital telling her to rush back in. She did not get the chance to speak to him again.\nAs he lay dying in his hospital bed, Alexander Litvinenko had remained the trained operative he had always been and tried to recall for police every detail that might hold a clue to his poisoning.\nFor the police, he was something unique - a living murder victim - a man who was going to die but had time to talk to them.\nSo who did he hold responsible for the mysterious illness which was taking such a terrible toll on his body? \"Everything that happened to him and he was able to speak - able to sign - he said Putin was responsible for his death,\" his widow told the BBC.\nThe public inquiry will examine the central question - who was responsible for what was described by a lawyer in a previous hearing as 'an act of state sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London'?\nIt was one of the most remarkable and sensitive murder cases in modern times.\n\"This inquiry was different from any other investigation that I've ever been involved in,\" says Peter Clarke, who at the time ran the Metropolitan Police Counter-Terrorism Command which handled the investigation.\n\"It was not only a murder inquiry but there were other key areas that we had to think about: public safety - over 40 sites of radioactive contamination in public places, on public transport, aircraft, offices, restaurants... And then there are the international dimensions, the diplomatic dimensions and the intelligence areas that came into this inquiry.\"\nMuch is already known about the broad brush of events - that Alexander Litvinenko was killed by radioactive Polonium 210 and that two Russians, Alexander Lugovoi and Dimitri Kovtun, are believed by police to be responsible.\nThey are believed to have administered the substance in a cup of tea at the Millennium Hotel's Pine Bar  in central London.  Both men, though, have denied any involvement.\nThis inquiry may reveal new details of the trail of evidence, though - a radioactive trail which shows that the Pine Bar may have been the third attempt to kill Litvinenko.\nBut one issue never publicly examined is that of motivation. Why was Litvinenko killed? And crucially - was it on the orders of the Russian state? That is one subject this inquiry will be looking at.\nLitvinenko was a former FSB officer who had become a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin, first in Russia and then in Britain where he eventually received citizenship.\nThe inquiry was formally created in July 2014 after the government finally relented in the face of pressure from Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert Owen, a judge then sitting as coroner but now chairman of the inquiry.\nThe inquest process had hit a major problem - the government had demanded that certain material be kept secret but there is no provision for that in an inquest.\nSo both Marina Litvinenko and Sir Robert argued that the inquest should be converted into a public inquiry in which material can be considered in closed session. The government at first resisted but Marina Litvinenko persisted with legal challenges even as her money began to run out.\nIn July the government changed its stance. This was seen in some quarters as a reaction to worsening relations with Moscow.\nIn the past there was suspicion that there was a desire to put the Litvinenko case to bed and get back to business but by last summer the crisis over Ukraine had changed Britain's perspectives on Russia and may have led to the decision to hold an inquiry which could look at the issue of state responsibility.\nAt a pre-inquest hearing, lawyers for the inquiry said that the material in possession of the British government did establish a 'prima facie case' for the culpability of the Russian state in the death. But this may well be secret intelligence which will not come out in public evidence.\nOne thing the inquiry will be unlikely to look at in open session is Alexander Litvinenko's relationship with MI6.\nAt one hearing, a lawyer for the widow of Alexander Litvinenko said that her husband had carried out work for MI6 and had a dedicated handler or case-officer with the pseudonym of Martin.\nThis, the lawyer argued, meant that the inquest needed to look at whether the British state failed in its duty of care to Alexander Litvinenko by failing to take sufficient steps to protect him - in other words, could it have prevented the murder? In the end that issue was ruled out of the final inquiry.\nIt has been a long journey. I first interviewed Marina soon after her husband's murder when she showed a determination to uncover the truth.\nSpeaking to her eight years on, she remains as firm as ever in that pursuit and still has confidence in the ability of the British justice system to deliver final answers, despite all the ups and downs on the way.\nThe next few months will be the final test of that.",

Vardy caught Mignolet off his line with his goal-of-the-season contender and then added a second 11 minutes later.\nThe Foxes had most of the game's big chances, Mignolet brilliantly denying a Mahrez curling strike as well as touching Okazaki's effort onto the crossbar. Moments before Vardy's second, the hosts should have had a penalty when Mamadou Sakho brought down Okazaki.\nFoxes midfielder Danny Drinkwater said: \"We're staying on the ground but if we carry on the way we are then why not have the belief [to win the league]? It would go down in history surely.\"\nVardy - who is set to sign a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the Foxes - had never scored a Premier League goal from outside the box with his first 21 top-flight attempts.\nHe let Mahrez's long ball bounce before smashing it over Mignolet. After the game he revealed he had seen the keeper stray off his line on previous occasions and decided to try his luck.\nLeicester midfielder Drinkwater told BBC Match of the Day: \"His first goal was incredible. You think he's going to square it but he hits it top corner. It sums his season up. He can turn an average ball into a great ball.\"\nLeicester boss Claudio Ranieri said: \"Amazing.

We could have played much better. We had a few shots where we could pass and a few passes where we could shoot. We created half chances but not real chances.

In a trailer for his show, he admits to \"torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them\".\nAnd it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank.\nSome celebrities have confirmed that this was the case.\nTunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor.\nIn one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake.\nThe show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared.\nSimilar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was \"unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame\".\nReligious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden.\nThe shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month.\nEgyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue.\nBut one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals.\nThe show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat.\nIt has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations.\nAs Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: \"Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective.\"\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

And there are plans for a further 10,000 people to get a separate experimental jab.\nThe results will be compared to see if either vaccine offers any meaningful protection against the virus.\nA version of the vaccine has already been tested on 200 healthy volunteers across the UK, US, Switzerland and Mali.\nGSK says it has been found to have an acceptable safety profile so far.\nBut it is only in affected countries that experts can determine whether it provides adequate protection against the virus.\nDr Moncef Slaoui, of GlaxoSmithKline said: \"Shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate Ebola vaccine.\n\"The initial phase one data we have seen are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing.\"\nThe company stresses the vaccine is still in development and the World Health Organization, and other regulators, would have to be satisfied the vaccine is both safe and effective before any mass immunisation campaigns could be considered.\nField trials of other promising vaccines - for example one involving the company Merck - are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the months to come.\nAnd there are reports that a trial of an experimental drug called Zmapp might start in the next few weeks.\nHowever, experts say with the number of Ebola cases falling opportunities to test vaccines and drugs could be limited.\nProf Jonathan Ball, a virus expert based at Nottingham University, told the BBC: \"Because case numbers are starting to come down it will become harder and harder to show if the vaccine is having any impact.\n\"Ultimately we may be in position in a few months time where we don't know whether this vaccine is effective in humans.\n\"But it is important to get answers if we can - if not for this outbreak, for future outbreaks.

    "document": "The finding deals a significant blow to the theory of physics known as supersymmetry.\nMany researchers had hoped the LHC would have confirmed this by now.\nSupersymmetry, or Susy, has gained popularity as a way to explain some of the inconsistencies in the traditional theory of subatomic physics known as the Standard Model.\nThe new observation, reported at the Hadron Collider Physics conference in Kyoto and outlined in an as-yet unpublished paper, is not consistent with many of the most likely models of Susy.\nProf Chris Parkes, who is the spokesperson for the UK participation in the LHCb experiment, told BBC News: \"Supersymmetry may not be dead but these latest results have certainly put it into hospital.\"\nSupersymmetry theorises the existence of more massive versions of particles that have already been detected.\nIf found, they might help explain the phenomenon known as dark matter. Galaxies appear to rotate faster at their edges than the matter we see can account for, and one set of candidates for this missing dark matter is supersymmetric particles.\nHowever, researchers at the LHCb detector have dealt a serious blow to hopes of finding them.\nThey have measured the decay between a particle known as a Bs meson into two particles known as muons. It is the first time that this decay has ever been observed, and the team has calculated that for every billion times that the Bs meson decays it only decays in this way three times.\nIf superparticles were to exist, the decay would happen far more often. This experiment is one of the \"golden\" tests for supersymmetry, and it would appear that this hugely popular theory among physicists has failed.\nThe result is at a statistical level of \"3.5 sigma\" - meaning that there is a one-in-4300 chance that the team would see the same \"bump\" in their data if the decay were not happening. This level makes the find worth further investigation, but falls well short of the 5-sigma level of certainty required for a formal discovery.\nProf Val Gibson, leader of the Cambridge University LHCb team, said that the new result was \"putting our supersymmetry theory colleagues in a spin\".\nThe results are in fact completely in line with what one would expect from the Standard Model. There is already concern that the LHCb's sister detectors might have expected to have detected superparticles by now, yet none has been found so far.\nIf supersymmetry is not an explanation for dark matter, then theorists will have to find alternative ideas to explain those inconsistencies in the Standard Model. So far researchers who are racing to find evidence of so called \"new physics\" have run into a series of dead ends.\n\"If new physics exists, then it is hiding very well behind the Standard Model,\" commented Cambridge physicist Dr Marc-Olivier Bettler, a member of the analysis team.\nThe result does not rule out the possibility that super particles exist. But according to Prof Parkes, \"they are running out of places to hide\".\nSupporters of supersymmetry, however, such as Prof John Ellis of King's College London, said that the observation is \"quite consistent with supersymmetry\".\n\"In fact,\" he said, \"(it) was actually expected in (some) supersymmetric models.  I certainly won't lose any sleep over the result.\"\n• The Standard Model is the simplest set of ingredients - elementary particles - needed to make up the world we see in the heavens and in the laboratory\n• Quarks combine together to make, for example, the proton and neutron - which make up the nuclei of atoms today - though more exotic combinations were around in the Universe's early days\n• Leptons come in charged and uncharged versions; electrons - the most familiar charged lepton - together with quarks make up all the matter we can see; the uncharged leptons are neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter\n• The \"force carriers\" are particles whose movements are observed as familiar forces such as those behind electricity and light (electromagnetism) and radioactive decay (the weak nuclear force)\n• The Higgs boson came about because although the Standard Model holds together neatly, nothing requires the particles to have mass; for a fuller theory, the Higgs - or something else - must fill in that gap\nFollow Pallab on Twitter",

Those are our values.\"\nDonald Trump's lawyers did not make their case. In fact, according to three Ninth Circuit judges, they didn't even really try to make their case. Rather than explaining why the temporary travel ban was needed, the administration argued that the president's authority on immigration was so sweeping that they didn't have to explain why the order was necessary.\nAccording to the court, the government was unable to say why Mr Trump's ban addressed a pressing national security threat that a temporary stay of the order would worsen. The lawyers for the challenging states, on the other hand, convinced the judges that re-imposing the order at this point would create further chaos by infringing on the due process rights of those on US soil, regardless of their immigration status.\nBy issuing a unanimous, unsigned opinion, the judges avoid accusations of partisan bias, as one of the three was a Republican appointee.\nMr Trump tweeted a sharp \"SEE YOU IN COURT\" following the decision - but which court?\nAn appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely, although a better move for the president may be to fight in the lower court until Judge Neil Gorsuch joins a conservative majority on the bench.\nThe executive order, at the end of Mr Trump's first week in office, had sparked protests and confusion as people were stopped at US borders.\nThen a week later, a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order that stopped the ban in its tracks, after Washington state and Minnesota sued.\nThe Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, which heard oral arguments this week.\nLawyers representing the US government argued that the ban was a \"lawful exercise\" of presidential authority.\nBut the two US states said the ban had harmed universities in their states and discriminated against Muslims.\nThe appeal judges did not rule on the constitutionality or the merits of the law, just on the question of its reinstatement.\nThe lower court in Seattle must still debate its merits and there are other legal challenges across the country.",

    "document": "Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham says he is \"struggling\" with whether UK action would be legal or not. So what are the key legal questions?\nParliament has already rejected military intervention in Syria, in 2013. Ministers say circumstances have changed since then (notably with the rise of IS) and that they would only proceed this time with the backing of Parliament. But this is not technically necessary. Although it has become convention since the 2003 Iraq war, there is no legal requirement for Parliamentary approval for military action.\nMinisters say they would not proceed without a Commons vote - but they believe they have the authority, under international law, to intervene. Last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said there was \"no legal bar\" to the UK operating in Syria. In September, David Cameron suggested the UK could legally take military action in Syria without a request from President Assad, saying the Syrian president is \"illegitimate\".\nThe UK is already carrying out air strikes on IS targets in Iraq. The UK says that as the Iraqi government requested intervention, this provides a \"clear and unequivocal legal basis\" for the military action. But no such request has been received from the Syrian government, and the UK sees the regime as illegitimate in any case. This means the legal arguments around intervention in Syria would be shaped by the complexities and conflicting interpretations of international law.\nThe UN Charter bans \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\" unless used in self-defence or authorised by a UN resolution. Those are the two \"classic justifications\" for military action, Prof Philippe Sands QC of University College London told the BBC.\nA UN resolution is unlikely given Russian opposition, leaving the option of self-defence. This would require ministers to show military action was needed to prevent attacks on the UK or its citizens emanating from Syria. Alternatively, the self-defence argument could be used in relation to Iraq, which has already requested military assistance. This is the argument used by the United States, which is carrying out air strikes in Syria.\nAs to whether this would work, \"we simply do not know enough about the facts\" to say definitely whether the self-defence argument is justified, says Prof Sands. He believes it would be \"a bit of a stretch\" on the basis of what is publicly available, adding that the UK appears to have \"no strategy and no clear basis of information to explain to the public what it is doing, and why it believes it is entitled in law to use force by way of self-defence\".\nAnother option would be to justify the action on humanitarian grounds. This was the basis of the government's case for intervention in 2013, when it focused on the possible use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Assad. Its legal position, published in August 2013, set out the three conditions that had to be met:\n\"This puts the evidential bar both high and wide,\" BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman wrote at the time.\nThe question would be whether the changed circumstances, with IS - also known as ISIS - militants controlling parts of Syria and fighting against government forces, would meet the test.\nDr Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC there would be a \"quite plausible case\".\n\"Given the behaviour we know of ISIS, the circumstances of the horrific civil war in Syria, it's not difficult to construct a case that the humanitarian danger is grave and is immediate,\" he says.\nAs well as the UN rules, \"customary international law\" has been established over the years.\nOne option would be the right of \"hot pursuit\" of IS across borders, Dr Eyal says. Given that Iraq has requested international assistance in the fight against IS militants, the UK could argue that unless it can pursue them into Syria, they could \"seek refuge across the border and the situation will never end\", he says.\nThis argument is strengthened by the inability of the Syria government to control its own territory he says, adding that hot pursuit is \"not an argument that lawyers are very comfortable with, but it has been made before\".\nNo. Both the hot pursuit and humanitarian intervention arguments are \"controversial and contested\", Dr Eyal says, with governments accused of \"abusing the system\".\nSome legal experts are not convinced any air strikes without specific Security Council authorisation would be consistent with international law, a Commons briefing paper points out.\nSort of. A US-led coalition is already carrying out air strikes in Syria. Last month it emerged UK pilots had been embedded with coalition forces and conducting air strikes over Syria against IS. Amid criticism from Labour, Mr Fallon said embedding forces was \"standard practice\" and their engagement was not a \"British military operation\".\nVery much so. The government's insistence on securing Parliamentary approval means it will be MPs' interpretations of these intricacies of international law that will be key.\nLast time MPs debated military intervention in Syria, opposition from backbench Conservatives and Ed Miliband-led Labour was enough to defeat the government.\nHowever, MPs have since overwhelmingly backed action in Iraq, where the target was IS militants. Since those votes, the make-up of the Commons has changed, with the Conservatives holding a majority.\nThe identity of Labour's next leader - with surprise frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn certain to oppose any air strikes - is another complicating factor.",

    "document": "For decades, large numbers of Haitians have migrated - many of them without papers - to the Dominican Republic, to escape the poverty and lack of employment in their homeland.\nIn 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality.\nAn 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status\".\nThousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities.\nAs the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division.\nWeekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair.\nThe church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches.\nLooking around the camp, one of several along Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, you might think that the parishioners have little to be thankful for.\nIt is surely one of the poorest places in Latin America.\nA year ago thousands of returning Haitians arrived at Parc Cadeau.\nSome had been forcibly deported from the Dominican Republic, others left voluntarily to avoid confrontation with the authorities.\nToday hundreds of families remain on the dusty ranch, living in hastily erected shacks of plastic sheeting, cardboard and rope, trapped in near stateless limbo.\nSoinicier Giles is typical of many in the camp.\nHe spent 22 years living as a farmer in the Dominican Republic, before being deported last year.\nHe takes me to a ramshackle hut to meet his wife Eleny and six of their eight children. The other two were left behind when he was deported.\nThe conditions are extremely harsh, especially for the youngest. \"We sleep directly on the floor and it gets wet inside when it rains,\" Eleny explains.\nThe children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself.\nThey are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp.\n\"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish.\nOne of the few local figures helping the returnees is the parish priest, Father Luc Leandre.\nWith funds from the International Organisation for Migration, he has helped relocate some of the most desperate families to nearby communities in Haiti.\n\"It's a grave crisis, very, very bad,\" Father Leandre tells me.\n\"The Church is like a mother for everyone and I have a duty to help. Not only that, the Pope told everyone they have to help the refugees wherever they are.\"\nBut Father Leandre says the attitude of some conservative priests on the other side of the border, particularly in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, has complicated his work.\n\"The cardinal in Santo Domingo is personally very vocal in his support for the deportations. He supported sending all the Haitians back to their country.\"\n\"It's racism,\" he laments, saying the law specifically targeted black Haitians, a charge denied by lawmakers in the Dominican Republic.\nThe priest Father Leandre was referring to has been the most influential voice in the Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic for almost 40 years: the controversial and outspoken Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez.\nEarlier this month, Pope Francis accepted the cardinal's resignation, which all archbishops are obliged to offer once they reach the age of 75.\nBut he will remain an important figure in the Church and in Dominican public life.\nThe BBC repeatedly requested an interview with Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus so he could respond to the criticisms against him but both he and his press secretary declined.\nIn many ways, the Haitian migrant crisis has exposed greater divisions within the Catholic Church in Hispaniola over where it should position itself in the 21st Century.\nPope Francis - both the first Jesuit pope and the first from Latin America - designated 2016 as the \"Year of Mercy\" and certainly Jesuits have been instrumental in supporting the Haitian returnees.\nIn a video that went viral, the cardinal was filmed in a furious diatribe about a Jesuit priest called Mario Serrano calling him \"shameless\" and a \"leftist\".\n\"He's not very accustomed to being publically confronted,\" Mario Serrano tells me from the northern border region of Dajabon, where he works with undocumented Haitians.\n\"I just said that (his) kind of speech was not according to the Catholic teaching and was not for a priest or a Christian.\n\"I think that really made him mad.\"\nSupporters of the new regularisation law, such as the former Dominican ambassador to the US, Flavio Espinal, deny that the legislation was either cruel or motivated by racism.\n\"Nothing's perfect and the process here has not been perfect. Yet this has been an extraordinary step forward in the direction of regularising close to 300,000 people who were undocumented in this country.\n\"That's not an easy decision to make nowadays.\"\nAt night, to avoid detection, the farmer Soinicier Giles leaves Parc Cadeau and slips back into the Dominican Republic, the border marked by the Pedernales River.\nThere he strips the trees for firewood to make charcoal, to sell to Dominican traders for a few dollars.\nHe knows the practice damages the fertility of the soil, but it's the only available source of income.\n\"This is the only way we can survive,\" he says, motioning at his family, stuck inside the world's forgotten migrant crisis.\nYou can hear more of Will Grant's report on Heart and Soul on the BBC World Service.",

That's where most refugees and others jump on board people smugglers' dinghies, risking their lives to enter Europe via the Greek islands.\nBut trust between Turkey and the EU is not strong. An \"action plan on migration\" between the two back in November failed to yield many results.\nThere has been little sign of Turkey cracking down on people-smugglers along its coastline, and limited evidence of the â‚¬3bn (Â£2.3bn; $3.3bn) the EU then promised Turkey in humanitarian aid.\nSo Mrs Merkel began a new push for what she hoped would be a better Turkish deal.\nDonald Tusk, the head of the European Council, which represents all EU member countries in Brussels, joined in the efforts (after all, he would be the summit host), flying to Turkey ahead of Monday's meeting.\nBut neither of these seasoned politicians were quite prepared for what is now being described as a \"Turkish bazaar\" here in Brussels.\nTurkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu arrived at the summit all smiles for the cameras.\n\"Turkey is ready to work with the European Union,\" he beamed - omitting to say at what price.\nThen, behind closed doors, he slammed the EU with a whole host of additional political and funding demands:\nEven a few months ago, my bet is that faced with this steep list of demands, EU countries would simply have turned their back and walked out.\nNot now.\nChancellor Merkel isn't the only one desperate to solve the migrant crisis: The EU's credibility is crumbling, its members have never looked less unified and Greece, stuck with tens of thousands of stalled migrants on top of being saddled with crippling euro debt repayments, threatens to implode.\nThe bottom line, for the EU, is to put off anybody and everybody from getting in dinghies or trying any means possible to get to Europe to improve their lives. It hopes to send every economic migrant back home and to pay to look after refugees in camps closer to theirs.\nVoters across Europe say they are spooked by the migrant crisis. But however much Europe's leaders and EU bosses in Brussels fear for their future, they can't compromise all their principles trying to make this problem \"go away\".\nAnd that is why last night's summit didn't end in a deal. Of course, triumphant words flew out of the mouths of leaders and broadcasters across Europe - \"turning point\", \"Big Bang\" and \"breakthrough\".\nBut that is only if - and it's a big if - the proposals are written up and signed at another migrant summit next week - and \"if\" they are then implemented.\nThere's a lot to think about.\nCan the EU afford to close its eyes to the Turkish president's increasingly autocratic and arguably anti-democratic behaviour in its rush to do a migration deal?\nJust before the summit, the Turkish government took over one of the country's best-selling newspapers and tear-gassed outraged protesters on the streets of Ankara, for example.\nAnd what of the legal implications of the EU exporting migrants en masse back to Turkey?\nThe UN has warned this could go against international humanitarian law, with some asylum cases needing to be heard here in Europe, they say. Turkey does not have asylum laws in place for Afghans and Iraqis for example, so what will happen to those migrants?\nAnd then there are the logistical challenges.\nImagine the scenes - not just young men, but old women, wheelchair users, pregnant mothers and screaming babies, many from Syria and other troubled areas. After all they've been through to to get to Greece, will they meekly accept getting on a boat or plane to be sent back to Turkey?\nAnd these are just some of the complications surrounding an EU-Turkey deal, never mind the splits in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis.\nSo, on Monday Angela Merkel got what she needed for her weekend elections: a tough-sounding something with the promise of a Turkey deal in the offing.\nConveniently for her, the votes will be counted in Germany before the talk from the summit begins to publicly unravel.",

    "document": "Longer life expectancies combined with higher living costs means working until you physically can't is a reality for many.\nHowever, that also means there's a trend emerging for a post-retirement career.\nJuliana Liu visited a Hong Kong restaurant where the hiring policy emphasises life experience over other skills, while Matthew Wheeler and Priti Gupta picked up some tips from the knitting grandmothers of Bangalore in India.\nWhen Choi Chor Tung approached his 65th birthday, he applied for a job at Gingko House, a Hong Kong social enterprise that mainly hires elderly workers at its four restaurants and the organic farm it uses to supply its eateries.\nMr Choi, who was at that point a butcher, wanted to join Gingko as he was afraid of being fired from his previous job because of his age.\n\"If you want to retire, then you have to have a lot of savings. But most people in Hong Kong don't have a lot of savings or pension money. It goes very quickly,\" he says. \"Only a place like this will employ someone of my age. I'm 66. I will keep working until I can't work any more.\"\nNow he is a full-time kitchen worker making salads and pizza at Gingko's flagship restaurant, which serves both Chinese and Western food.\nIn Hong Kong, the sight of wizened, weather-beaten men and women bending over rubbish bins to collect scraps for sale is all too familiar. They are part of a dark secret: this city is one of the world's most unequal places in terms of income distribution.\nAbout one in five of its seven million people live in poverty, according to government figures. Among the elderly, one in three lives below the poverty line. In fact, the most recent official data suggests the poverty rate among people over 65 years of age has risen by 19% between 2009 and 2014.\nCity officials believe the best way to reduce poverty is to expand economic growth and create jobs but elderly people say age-related discrimination is pervasive.\nThat's why Joyce Mak, a former social worker, started the social enterprise 10 years ago.\nShe had no experience in the restaurant business but wanted to provide a sustainable way of employing senior citizens for as long as they were willing to work.\nSince then, Gingko has employed more than 1,000 elderly people.\nBangalore is one of the world's major tech cities. It is India's IT hub. And, thanks to Lima Das and her team of industrious grannies, it is now India's knitting hub too.\nIn 2011, Lima set up grannysloveindia.com, a website that sells children's clothes knitted by grandmothers. It's an idea that has enabled women \"in the second innings of their life\" to find new purpose and make new friends.\n\"I had no clue it would reach a stage like this where people accept it, love the social cause of it,\" Lima says, sitting in her Bangalore apartment surrounded by stacks of wool.\n\"It's been great to be part of such a change. The grannies have now become more confident. They have become a part of my life and I have become a part of their life, empowering them and making them realise that they can become entrepreneurs at any stage of their life.\"\nLima, a textile design graduate, got the idea for Granny's Love when she saw her mother-in-law knitting. \"I thought if I give her design directions she can come up with something fabulous.\"\nThe business relies on a combination of new technology (the internet and social media apps) and good old-fashioned craft (knitting nans). All orders from the website arrive in Lima's email inbox.\nShe then creates the design, identifies the granny best suited to knit it, and sends the wool and the design to that granny. \"Then, after a week, [the granny] sends back the product, other details are added, and it's packed together with a photo of the granny who made it, and posted to the customer,\" says Lima.\nGetting the customers wasn't a problem. The challenge was to find the grannies and persuade them that knitting was a moneymaking skill.\n\"I would ask any granny I would meet, 'Do you knit? Do you know this craft?' My biggest challenge was to motivate them. They simply made garments for their families. For them money was not in their mind.\"\nThe orders have rolled in, along with a regular flow of positive feedback from customers. And with the grannies becoming more confident with using modern technology, such as Facebook and Snapchat, they are now getting that feedback directly.\nHow social entrepreneurs are tackling the world's problems\nSpecial Report: Changing the Rules\n\"The grannies are now more proactive when it comes to getting an order. They talk to the customers, they come with me to exhibitions.\"\nLima now has 25 grannies working with her all across India. Shanti Nagpal is one of the recent recruits. \"Today I have courage to believe in myself,\" she says, pausing between stitches on her latest garment. \"When I see our knitting creations worn by the children and looking so beautiful, it makes me feel proud.\"\nSuman Prakash, Lima's longest serving knitting nan, finds the work relaxing and spends much of her earnings on more wool so she can knit more clothes for her family. \"It's giving me purpose.

Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst.\nIn second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game.\nIn team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor.\nProbably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club\nWasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of.\nNot the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them.\nAn opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind.\nLargely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of.\nCeltic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better.\nWhenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat.\nNot the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that.\nWon a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor.\nExpect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything.\nBarely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down.\nHad that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit.\nFairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively.\nWas probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout.\nStrong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure.\nAttacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target.\nMan of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example.\nSolid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position.\nAlways capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal.\nScored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did.\nProbably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be.\nProbably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well.\nDid what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield.\nAnother who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic.\nDidn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong.\nPat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.",

It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it?\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand\nHere is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now.\nWhat I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you.\nSome players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more.\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards.\nPerhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice.\nSo is it possible to get big enough taking food alone?\nThe IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby.\n\"The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36% of the IRB's entire programme.\"\nThat means around 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol.\nThe 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1%.\nMy guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don't know.\nWhen I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids. They were often accompanied by parents.\nCould this happen here?\nSam Chalmers was in the most susceptible group, which is young lads who want to get into professional, or at least top-level, rugby.\nIt's going to be tough on him. But life's not easy. It wasn't easy for the players and coaches in the \"Bloodgate\" affair, or in the various eye-gouging allegations, nor for the other 60-odd rugby players caught by the IRB taking drugs or tampering with their samples.\nThis is a test. He does his time and then he gets back in the game.\nI will leave you with this thought: I bet you he wasn't alone in this. And I bet there are younger players than Sam Chalmers who haven't been caught.\nWhat do you think?

An attack on the journalists was ordered that night, the lawsuit says.\n\"The transmissions were intercepted, and they were tracked to their GPS co-ordinates,\" said one of the legal team, Scott Gilmore.\n\"On top of that there was a whole web of informants who were already out searching for the journalists. Any journalist in Homsâ€¦ could have been a target\".\nMarie's photographer, Paul Conroy, had told the BBC shortly after the attack that the incoming rounds were \"bracketed\" on the media centre, meaning they were being deliberately targeted.\nConroy had served in an artillery regiment in the British Army.\n\"As an artilleryman, I think that was a good day's work for a for a well-trained team. Nothing smacked of randomness in that situation,\" he said.\nNow the family's lawyers say they have witnesses and documents smuggled out of Syria to prove this.\nThe lawsuit is the fruit of four years of research by the US-based Center for Justice and Accountability.\nThe documents are said to show that the artillery strike was approved or ordered by President Assad's brother Maher, commander of the Republican Guards.\nThe policy of targeting journalists is alleged to have been made by senior officials in the Central Crisis Management Cell, President Assad's war cabinet.\n\"I'm really proud to be able to bring this lawsuit,\" said Marie Colvin's sister, Cat. \"We know who Marie's killers are now; we want them brought to justice. I want them to be held accountable.\"\nShe went on: \"I'm very sensitive to the suffering of the Syrian people.

I want to give a voice to the Syrian people. I want them to know we haven't forgotten them.\"\nThe shelling in Baba Amr was the most intense any of us in the BBC team had ever seen.\nThe Syrians there were all wondering if this would be another Hama - the town destroyed by the old President Assad's artillery in 1982. Some 10,000-20,000 people were killed - there is still no accurate estimate - but not a single image was published of the carnage.\nIn the age of the cameraphone and YouTube, that was not going to happen in Baba Amr.\nBut - we believed - the regime still feared what effect the presence of international journalists would have.\n\"We could destroy Baba Amr in 10 minutes, if there were no cameras,\" a regime official is supposed to have said, according to documents and witness statements obtained by the Colvin family's lawyers.\nThe lawsuit says Marie was deliberately murdered according to orders given by some of the most senior officials in the Syrian regime.\nOne of those who helped carry out the attack is said to have been rewarded by the Assad family with the gift of a car.\nThese are allegations, yet to be tested in court.

    "document": "At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims.\nIt has called on the government to offer tax breaks to encourage building and investment in the sector.\nThe Conservative Party has indicated its focus remains on home ownership.\nThe number of UK households renting property rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 5.4 million in 2014, according to Rics.\nIt said that any further investment in property by landlords had been hit by changes to stamp duty in April.\nAnyone buying a home that is not their main residence must now pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated.\nThis led to a spike in property purchases in March, with transactions falling quickly again thereafter. Next year, landlords are likely to be hit again when their right to deduct their mortgage interest from their income tax bill is removed.\nRics suggests that the stamp duty increase should be reversed, a move which would infuriate potential first-time buyers - many of whom say they are regularly outbid by buy-to-let investors.\nGeneration Rent, a group that campaigns for better conditions for tenants, said the higher rate of stamp duty was a good thing.\n\"It does give first-time buyers a much-needed advantage against people who are simply betting that house prices will keep going up,\" said Dan Wilson Craw, the policy manager of Generation Rent.\n\"In the first three months of the surcharge, the tax on second homes raised £424m - that cash could help build new homes for people on low incomes.\"\nA body that represents landlords said that rents were likely to rise.\n\"Tenants will be hurt most, as landlords recover the stamp duty increase by charging tenants more,\" said David Cox, the managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA).\n\"The simple answer is that we need to build more homes.\"\nIn addition to a reversal in the stamp duty increase, Rics also called for:\nRics' call comes just a day after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would take \"unprecedented steps\" to encourage construction of homes for people to buy.\nHe told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham that the housing shortage was \"a huge issue for our country\" and would be his \"number-one priority\".\nHe said: \"Far too many young people cannot get a foot on the housing ladder. Many are being forced to live back with mum and dad as rents soar faster than wages.\"\nAmong the plans announced was an Accelerated Construction scheme, using £2bn of new public sector borrowing to make public land with outline planning permission available to builders.\nWhere can I afford to live?",

    "document": "The Bristol-raised creator of the Open Bionics project says he can 3D-scan an amputee and build them a custom-fitted socket and hand in less than two days.\nIt typically takes weeks or months to obtain existing products.\nJoel Gibbard says he aims to start selling the prosthetics next year.\n\"We have a device at the lower-end of the pricing scale and the upper end of functionality,\" he told the BBC.\n\"At the same time it is very lightweight and it can be customised for each person.\n\"The hand is basically a skeleton with a 'skin' on top. So, we can do different things to the skin - we can put patterns on it, we can change the styling and design. There's quite a lot of flexibility there.\"\nThe 25-year-old inventor intends to charge customers £2,000 for the device, including the cost of a fitting.\nAlthough prosthetic arms fitted with hooks typically can be bought for similar prices, ones with controllable fingers are usually sold for between £20,000 and £60,000.\nThat cost can sometimes be prohibitive for children, who usually need to change their prosthetic once or twice a year to take account of their growth.\nOpen Bionics' hand relies on myoelectric signals, meaning it detects muscle movements via sensors stuck to the owner's skin and uses them to control its grip.\nA single flex of the wearer's muscles opens and closes the fingers, while a double flex changes the shape to form a pinch grip.\nAlthough the user cannot feel what the fingers are touching, sensors built into the digits can tell when they come into contact with an object to limit the pressure they exert.\nThis means owners can pick up objects as fragile as an egg without crushing them.\nHowever, Mr Gibbard acknowledges there are still some limitations to his design.\n\"We're using lower-cost motors than they have in high-end devices, so the overall strength is lower,\" he said.\n\"So, we are testing it with users and household objects and trying to come to a compromise that means it is very affordable and still has enough power to do most of the stuff that people want.\"\nThe UK engineering prize includes a £2,220 reward and the chance to compete for an international title worth $45,000 (£28,600).\nBut, perhaps more valuably, it will also help the project gain wider recognition.\n\"Joel Gibbard is to be congratulated in advancing the availability of functioning prosthetic devices at affordable prices,\" commented Miss Barbara Jemec, founding chair of the British Foundation for International Reconstructive Surgery and Training (BFirst), on learning of the prize.\n\"Amputees, especially in developing countries, such as Sierra Leone where the civil war left many upper limb amputees, need to have access to affordable and durable prosthetics that work.\n\"A working hand can make all the difference between hunger and being able to work and take care of yourself and your family. I shall be following the development with interest.\"\nOpen Bionics started as a bedroom-based crowdfunding project in 2013, which was supported by Bristol Robotics Laboratory.\nSince then the design has been revised 10 times, and the number of separate parts radically reduced.\nMr Gibbard says he can now size up a user in a matter of minutes using a tablet equipped with a special sensor, 3D-print the parts in about 40 hours, and finally fit them together in a further two hours.\n\"The original design was primarily made of different plastic parts that were screwed and bolted together along with off-the-shelf components,\" he recalls.\n\"It took a very long time to build, and because it was all made of plastic it was subject to a lot of weak points where it could break.\n\"The new design is made of thermoplastic elastomer, which is basically a flexible rubbery plastic.\n\"So, we're able to print something in far fewer pieces and then have flexible joints.\n\"That means it's much more robust to impact forces and it requires much less assembly, so there are savings in cost, time and improvements in performance.\"\nWhile the current design only supports patients whose limb loss is limited to their forearms, the ultimate goal is to be able to help those with above-elbow amputations as well.\nThe roboticist is currently based in Los Angeles where his work is being supported by Walt Disney's  Techstars Accelerator mentorship and investment programme.\nAlthough he intends to start a business by selling custom-made robotic hands in the second half of 2016, the project is also \"open source\" - meaning anyone can share and use its designs without charge so long as they in turn share any improvements they make.\nThis is not the first time a James Dyson Award has gone to a robotic appendage.\nIn 2013, the University of Pennsylvania's Titan Arm - an exoskeleton for one arm designed to help people with back injuries - won the top prize.",

This is a national problem, Mr Obama said. \"But it's a solvable problem.\"\nThe president spoke after a day of meetings with mayors, civil rights leaders and law enforcement officials at the White House.\nThey discussed a programme that currently provides redundant US military tactical gear to local police departments, free of charge.\nMr Obama said he has asked federal agencies for recommendations to ensure the programme is not building a \"militarised culture\" in domestic police forces.\nPolice in Ferguson, Missouri, were criticised for being heavy-handed in dealing with protests sparked by the shooting of Michael Brown in August.\nThe funds requested by Mr Obama would be spread over three years and some of the money will go towards purchasing 50,000 body cameras for police officers as well as resources to reform law enforcement departments.\nBody cameras can provide evidence of encounters between police and civilians, particularly in disputed cases such as the Ferguson shooting.\nThe president said the stories of discrimination that young people had told him at the White House on Monday \"violate my belief about what America can do\".\nHe also unveiled a taskforce on modern policing, to be chaired by Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey.\nAlso on Monday, a commission tasked with making recommendations on issues stemming from the fatal shooting has convened in Ferguson.\nThe 16-member panel, stood up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, will consider changes in areas including public interaction with law enforcement and community stability.\nThe officer who shot Brown in Ferguson, Darren Wilson, resigned from the force over the weekend.\nThe decision not to charge Mr Wilson days earlier triggered a nationwide debate over relations between black communities and law enforcement.\nThe policeman said he had feared for his life.\nBrown's supporters said the teenager was attempting to surrender when he was shot.

    "document": "Released by Norwich City as a schoolboy, he entered semi-professional football, turning out for King's Lynn and Staines Town, who play in the Ryman Premier Division.\nIt was there, in the foothills of the English game, that he looked west and decided to move to the United States.\nDwyer signed up to a firm who - for a fee - help organise soccer scholarships at US colleges for young, talented British footballers.\nGetting a scholarship means the college pays some, or all, of the student's tuition fees and costs.\nThe firm, Soccer Icon USA, held a trial at QPR's training ground, to see whether those who had signed up were good enough for college soccer.\n\"I think I scored a hat-trick in the first 10 minutes,\" remembers Dwyer, now 25.\n\"The coaches took me off early and said: 'So - whereabouts in America do you want to go?'\"\nDwyer spent two years at Tyler Junior College in Texas, before moving to the University of South Florida.\nWhile there, he was signed by Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City. He has since scored more than 30 MLS goals, was named in the 2014 All Star team alongside Thierry Henry and, in 2015, is on a guaranteed salary of more than £300,000 a year.\nHe is also married to Sydney Leroux, who was a member of the USA's World Cup-winning women's team earlier this year.\n\"It's pretty amazing,\" says Dwyer. \"I'm a little kid from England, and last year I was at the White House [after winning the 2013 MLS Cup].\n\"I just thought: 'What are they doing, letting me in here?'\"\nDwyer is not the only British player who has gone from US college to the MLS.\nMatt Watson - who studied at the University of Maryland, after being released by Wolves as a youngster - plays for Chicago Fire.\nOtis Earle, son of former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle, is at FC Dallas, via the University of California, Riverside.\nPreston-born Luke Mulholland, who studied in North Carolina, is at Real Salt Lake, while Andy Rose, once a Bristol City youth, went from the University of California in Los Angeles to Seattle Sounders.\nFew Britons will emulate their careers. But more and more are trying.\nAccording to the Fulbright Commission, almost 11,000 British students were at American colleges in the past academic year - an increase of 21% in the past 10 years.\nAlthough the number of soccer scholarships is not recorded (there's no American equivalent of Ucas, the organisation through which applications are processed in England and Wales) it is clear they are becoming more popular.\nChris Cousins, who runs Sports Recruiting USA, went to Illinois on a soccer scholarship in 2003.\n\"I was probably one of a dozen going to America, if that,\" he says.\nNow, he estimates that more than 600 British students - male and female - will cross the Atlantic to start soccer scholarships this year.\nCousins thinks rising tuition fees in England is one factor, having increased from £1,100 in 2003 to a maximum of £9,000 a year now. He also thinks social media has played a part.\n\"When you see your mate on Twitter or Facebook playing in California or Florida, it makes it more tempting,\" said Cousins.\nCollege soccer is certainly attractive: in 2013, more than 30 teams had average attendances of more than 1,000, 10 with more than a 2,000 average, with some derbies attracting over 10,000 fans. To put that in perspective, last season English League Two sides Morecambe and Accrington both averaged less than 2,000.\nThe biggest games are shown on national television, and there is a clear route to turning pro: every year, MLS clubs take their pick of the best college players via the superdraft.\nBut there is another reason why more Britons are heading to American colleges - the rise in companies, or middlemen, who arrange soccer scholarships.\nPass4Soccer, which began in 2003, was one of the first. According to their latest annual report, they now have 40 competitors.\n\"It seems in the past 12 years they've sprung up left, right, and centre,\" said Daniel Gray, a director at the company.\n\"Five years ago, there were 10 or 15. Now there are 40. People are jumping on the bandwagon.\"\nEach firm is different but, broadly, the model is the same. Students pay a fee, and the company gets them a place at a US college - if they are good enough on the pitch and are capable of getting a degree.\nThe companies' fees vary. Sports Recruiting USA, one of the cheapest, charges £999; Pass4Soccer is £1,295; others charge more than £2,000.\nThe firms claim it is money well spent - they say, with contacts and experience, they are able to get better scholarships for their students.\nPass4Soccer, for example, estimate that 15% of their students get full scholarships - meaning the college pays all of the student's fees and living costs.\nSports Recruiting USA say their students, on average, get 90% scholarships - leaving students to pay just 10%.\nWhen a year at a US college costs the average international student more than £20,000, paying £1,000 or £2,000 to a firm could be a wise investment.\nBut, as one QPR player knows, not everyone needs a middleman.\nWhen Tyler Blackwood was 18, he had - in his own words - \"given up\".\nAs a schoolboy, Tottenham Hotspur said he was too short. Watford said the same, as did Northampton Town.\nAfter a growth spurt, Blackwood, who is now over 6ft, was invited to a trial game at lower-league Barnet.\nBut, on the day of the game, the manager Paul Fairclough resigned and his trial never happened. Instead, he began working in his dad's bar in Oakwood, north London.\n\"It was a horrible year,\" remembers Blackwood. \"I had friends in the pro game, and I was watching them make their debuts.\n\"Football had always been my plan, then suddenly I realised - it's not going to happen.\"\nWhen his dad encouraged him to kickstart his career at an American college, they paid for a firm to arrange a scholarship.\n\"But the offers were from bad schools in terrible states,\" says Blackwood. \"In the end, I got my money back and did it myself.\"\nIn 2011, the family went on holiday to Florida, so Blackwood emailed the soccer coach at the University of Tampa, asking for a trial.\nThe college accepted him, but offered only a 25% scholarship.\n\"My dad borrowed money, took out loans, to make sure he could pay the rest,\" says Blackwood, now 24.\n\"I told him he'd only have to pay for the first year, and then I'd get a full scholarship. And I did.\"\nThis summer, Blackwood returned to England for a trial at QPR. It was successful, and he made his debut in August, away to Yeovil in the League Cup.\nHe is completing his four-year degree in London, taking his laptop on the team bus to catch up with work.\n\"I recently had an exam that started at 8pm, Florida time,\" says Blackwood.\n\"That was 1am in the UK. I'm looking forward to graduating, put it that way.\"\nAs Blackwood shows, the quality of British players heading to America, as well as the quantity, is increasing.\nCousins says that, 10 years ago, it was \"county players getting the best scholarships - now it's people getting released from Chelsea and Manchester City\".\nBut what do British players offer that Americans - or other nationalities - do not?\n\"Work ethic sets them apart,\" says Steve Clements, who coached Dom Dwyer at Tyler Junior College in Texas.\n\"I must have had 100 British players, and they've always been hard-working. For example, nobody outworked Dom.\n\"Fantastic player, fantastic person, and a good friend. At Christmas, I came into my office and there he was, on a surprise visit.\n\"He didn't even tell me he was coming. He's that sort of guy.\"\nAnd, says Clements, the British bring something else to the team, as well as hard work.\n\"The Brits have fantastic humour. They're sarcastic, you know? And they can play.\"\nFor those who do not make it professionally, the college degree is a decent consolation.\nGraduates from soccer scholarships move into a range of careers: one of Clements's former British students works for Bank of America, another supplies souvenirs to major league sports (\"If you need a number one finger, I know who to call,\" he says).\nJoe Prince-Wright went on a soccer scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh and came back with two degrees: one in communication, and one in English writing.\nThose qualifications helped him become a website editor for the American network, NBC, in London.\n\"Academically, college was an eye-opener,\" he says.\n\"You only focus on your main subject in the last two years, so I was doing algebra classes, astronomy classes, everything.\n\"We'd have classes, train for three hours a day, then have more classes. On a Friday you might fly three hours to Tampa, and have a game there.\n\"On a Saturday, you'd fly four hours to Chicago, train, play on the Sunday, fly back, then start another week of classes.\n\"It was like being a full-time student and a professional soccer player.\"\nOne man who values a college education is Dwyer, who turned professional before finishing his degree in communications and psychology.\nHowever, despite his fame and fortune, he plans to complete his course, graduate, and finish the adventure he started six years ago.",

The department yet again failed to learn from previous disasters, like the Metronet contract. It failed to heed advice from its lawyers. It failed to respond appropriately to early warning signs that things were going wrong.\n\"Senior management did not have proper oversight of the project. Cuts in staffing and in consultancy budgets contributed to a lack of key skills.\n\"The project suffered from a lack of leadership. There was no single person responsible from beginning to end and, therefore, no one who had to live with the consequences of bad policy decisions.\n\"For three months, there was no single person in charge at all. Not only that, there was no senior civil servant in the team responsible for the work, despite the critical importance of this multi-billion pound franchise.\"\nThe committee had been \"astonished\" that the Department for Transport's top civil servant had been \"told he could not see all the information which might have enabled him to challenge the processes, although it was one of the most important tasks for which the department is responsible\".\nMrs Hodge added: \"Given that the department got it so wrong over this competition, we must feel concern over how properly it will handle future projects, including HS2 and Thameslink [rail routes].\"\n\"The department needs to get its house in order and put basic principles and practices at the heart of what it does, with an appropriately qualified and senior person in charge of the project throughout and an accessible leadership team ready and willing to hear and act on warning signs.\"\nIn October, the government scrapped its decision to award the £5bn franchise to FirstGroup.\nThe mistakes in the West Coast process came to light after rival bidder Virgin Trains launched a legal challenge against the decision. Virgin will continue running the service until November 2014, when a new long-term franchise will begin.\nIn December, the National Audit Office calculated that there would be a \"significant cost to the taxpayer\" as a result of the fiasco.\nIt said costs for staff, advisers, lawyers and the two reviews into the fiasco added up to £8.9m, on top of the estimated £40m it will take to reimburse firms for the cost of their bids.\nBob Crow, the leader of the RMT union, which represents rail workers, called for wholesale renationalisation of the railways.\n\"The stench from the fall-out of the West Coast franchise continues to hang over Britain's transport industry as it becomes clearer with every examination that the ministers responsible for this shambles could not be trusted to run a whelk stall let alone multi-billion government contracts,\" he said.\n\"Privatisation is a corrosive and expensive political project doomed to repeated and costly failure, twice on the East Coast and now on the West,\" he added.\n\"Fiddling with processes won't work. It's the whole, rotten policy that needs dumping with a return to public ownership.\"\nBut a Department for Transport spokesman said: \"The independent Laidlaw inquiry published in December identified the unique and exceptional circumstances which led to failures in the West Coast franchising programme and crucially what steps the department should take to prevent this from happening again.\n\"The department has accepted all the recommendations and has taken immediate steps by bringing together all rail activity under a single director general and recruiting a senior director to lead the franchising programme, as well as improving internal governance and strengthening oversight and accountability.\n\"Not only will these reinforce the franchising process but will also protect rail infrastructure projects such as HS2 and the biggest programme of rail electrification.\"\nMaria Eagle, the shadow transport secretary, called on Prime Minister David Cameron to \"take responsibility for the rail franchising fiasco, instead of allowing ministers to hide behind their civil servants\".\n\"The government must accept the finding of the Public Accounts Committee that it was the short-sighted decision by ministers to axe external audits of multi-billion pound contracts that ended up with at least £50m of taxpayers' money going down the drain,\" she added.\n\"It is a disgrace that every politician responsible for the bungled franchise deal has either remained in the cabinet or been promoted to it.\"\nRichard Hebditch of Campaign for Better Transport, which fights for better public transport, said the report showed the biggest problem was the franchising system itself.\n\"Franchising needs to be completely reformed so that what counts are improvements to the service on offer, rather than complex calculations of profit and loss that don't stack up,\" he said.",

Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season.\nThe difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous.\nPat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live\nI understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season.\nThe club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff.\nQuite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories.\nOn 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their \"unwavering support\". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer.\nHis departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla.\n\"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla,\" said BBC sports editor Dan Roan.\n\"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences.\"\nFoxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City.\n\"But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be.\n\"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City.\"\nSrivaddhanaprabha added: \"His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve.\n\"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign.\n\"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\"\nA news conference with Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at 13:00 GMT on Friday.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThis content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser\n14 February 2016: Leicester lose 2-1 at Arsenal, their final defeat of the 2015-16 season before a 12-game unbeaten run.\n2 May 2016: The Foxes are crowned champions of England for the first time in their history as Tottenham draw at Chelsea.\n16 July 2016: Midfielder N'Golo Kante leaves to sign a five-year deal with Chelsea.\n13 August 2016: Leicester lose their first game of the 2016-17 season - a 2-1 defeat at Hull City.\n15 October 2016: The Foxes are hammered 3-0 by table-topping Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\n22 November 2016: Leicester secure top spot in their Champions League group with one game to spare.\n18 December 2016: Ranieri is named Coach of the Year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards.\n7 February 2017: After a run of two wins in 15 league games, Leicester give Ranieri their \"unwavering support\".\n22 February 2017: The Foxes lose 2-1 to Sevilla in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.\n23 February 2017: Ranieri is sacked.",

    "document": "Mr Besigye is running against Mr Museveni in the presidential elections for the fourth time, after losing his previous three attempts.\nHe promised in an interview with Uganda's Daily Monitor paper in 2013 that he would not run again but would use other means \"to dismantle the dictatorship\".\nA year later he was still insistent that he would not run, telling Uganda's Observer newspaper that it is impossible to win an election that is being controlled by Mr Museveni.\nBut in 2015, he changed his mind.\nHis campaign rallies for the 2016 election have been characterised by supporters handing over donations, including bunches of bananas and live goats - a stark contrast to most campaign rallies on the continent, which see the candidates distributing gifts hoping to secure the votes of the beneficiaries.\nMr Besigye says previous elections have been rigged and that he has been the victim of a campaign of intimidation by the security forces.\nSome seven months before the 2016 election, Mr Besigye was arrested ahead of a campaign rally, accused of violating public order laws by attempting to hold public meetings without the government's permission.\nOn his way to another rally three days before the election, he was briefly held by police who accused him of disrupting the traffic.\nMr Besigye has been arrested on numerous occasions.\nOn one occasion he was shot in the hand, on another he suffered eye injuries after being doused in pepper spray.\nThe authorities have said Mr Besigye is provoking them, and he has been charged with inciting violence.\nThe charismatic Mr Besigye, 59, is married to Winnie Byanyima, a former MP who is seen as intelligent and ambitious and who was once a close personal friend of Mr Museveni. Mr Besigye and his wife have one son.\nHe was born in the western Rukungiri District, the second child in a family of six and the son of a policeman.\nBesigye's dates with history:\nBoth his parents died while he was at secondary school.\nIn 1975, he headed to Kampala and to medical school at what was then the region's most prestigious university, Makerere.\nIdi Amin was president of Uganda at the time and his army was causing misery in many areas of the country, including on the university campus.\nMr Besigye did not escape that treatment. Aged 18, he was in a Kampala hotel about to have dinner. Walking to the toilets, he stopped to talk to a former classmate.\nA huge man lifted him up by the collar, slapped him hard across the face and sent him sprawling to the floor.\nHe said he never made it to the toilets, and never ate his dinner. He picked himself up and ran for his life.\nFollowing Amin's overthrow, the qualified doctor became a member of the Uganda People's Movement of Yoweri Museveni.\nThe movement had little success in the 1980 election which saw the return of Milton Obote to power, and which is widely considered to have been rigged.\nMr Besigye told the East African newspaper that he did not immediately join Mr Museveni in the bush war.\nBut he was imprisoned for two months in the Nile Hotel in 1981, accused of working with the rebels, and tortured.\nMr Besigye fled to Nairobi and in 1982 joined Mr Museveni in the bush, where he became his personal doctor.\nAlthough rarely at the battle front, Mr Besigye was deployed in divisions which were sent into battle where he treated the casualties.\nKizza Besigye on his 2001-2005 exile:\n\"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened\"\nWhen Mr Museveni came to power, Mr Besigye, aged just 29, was appointed state minister of internal affairs and national political commissar.\nThese appointments shocked some who had been in the bush with Mr Besigye, as he had not been heavily involved in the political side of the bush war.\nSome believe Mr Besigye's rapid rise led to him being viewed as a potential threat to the president, and as a result he was given less demanding work during the 1990s.\nMr Besigye rose to the rank of colonel in the army but did not retire from it until shortly before the 2001 elections - having written a document that accused the ruling National Resistance Movement of being undemocratic, dishonest and corrupt. It almost earned him a court martial.\nA few months before the election, he emerged as a presidential candidate.\nHaving lost to Mr Museveni, he went to court and challenged the result on the grounds that the state had used force, intimidation and violence.\nHe lost the case on a split decision and then fled the country.\nOn his return in 2005 he said: \"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened.\"\nMore on Uganda's election:\nAfter he returned to Uganda ahead of the 2006 elections, he was arrested and charged with both treason and rape.\nThe charges were later dismissed, but not until long after the polls and they obviously distracted him from campaigning.\nThe rape prosecution was dismissed as \"crude and amateurish\" but the treason charges hung over his head until 2010.\nHis lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the 2006 results, alleging widespread fraud. Mr Besigye won 37%.\nThe government says Mr Besigye has connections with a rebel group, and this accusation led to charges.\nHe denied any rebel link, although he has said he would not rule out going to the bush to battle the government if the constitution was overthrown and needed to be reinstated.\nAfter he lost the last election in 2011, Mr Besigye said all the votes were flawed.\nBefore the 2011 polls, Mr Besigye had called for popular uprisings in the event of fraud.\nAnd after gaining 26% to the president's 68% in the vote, the leader of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) claimed it was rigged.\nAfter the election he continued to campaign against the result, along with the rising cost of living, by staging \"walk to work\" protests.\nHe was arrested four times, accused of inciting violence and beaten by police during the protests before all charges were dropped.\nHuman rights groups condemned the brutality of the police and military.\nHis critics see him as a power-hungry attention seeker. But others praise him for standing up to authority.\nMr Besigye himself says his mission is \"to work with millions of other Ugandans in bringing about a stable democratic and peaceful Uganda\".",

The societal need is there.\n\"A full-blown undergraduate degree - I'd be surprised if that didn't happen within five years.\n\"Will it be fully online? Or will it have some residential components? That remains to be seen.\"\nProf Koller said the technology had kept improving, but universities had been held back by the \"protection of the brand\" and not wanting to be seen to move away from personal tuition.\n\"It's the perception we need to break, it's not the technology that's been the barrier,\" she said.\nIn terms of supervising exams for distance learners, she said that webcams are \"surprisingly hard to beat\".\nProf Koller said concerns about impersonal online learning were often built on an unrealistic image of traditional campus-based teaching - and that most students are not \"walking on lawns next to ivy-clad buildings\".\n\"It's a false comparison to think it's either anonymous online teaching or else a cosy armchair and individual tutors.\n\"When you have a lecture hall with 300 people, you're not getting personal interaction.\"\nOnline learning should not be compared \"with some utopian ideal of 10 people sitting around in a seminar room engaging deeply with an instructor\".\nProf Koller says that online learning is going to become the route for students who want to improve their qualifications but who cannot afford the time or money to study for a campus-based degree.\n\"Many working adults have obligations, they have a job, a family, a mortgage, they can't go back to school.\"\nIn countries such as India, with ambitious targets to expand higher education, Prof Koller says the authorities will have to use online universities, because there is insufficient capacity in bricks-and-mortar institutions.\nThere are also efforts to use online learning to teach refugees, such as those displaced by Syria's civil war.\nCoursera has announced a partnership with the US State Department to help refugees to access online courses to improve their job chances, such as English language lessons or computer coding.\nIt would remove any costs from studying, such as fees for certificates showing the completion of courses.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\nCoursera was founded four years ago, part of a wave of online university projects that were claimed to be about to revolutionise higher education, making it cheaper and more accessible to students around the world.\nMany millions signed up for free short courses - but Prof Koller is predicting another stage with online learning being incorporated into formal fee-charging degree courses from mainstream universities.\nThere are already many online degrees offered - but Prof Koller says that in the past, such distance learning was seen as something \"respectable universities do not engage in\".\nThere are signs that this change is already beginning to happen.\nThe UK's online university platform, Futurelearn, has announced a project with the University of Leeds, in which course units studied online will count as credits towards an undergraduate degree.\nStudents from this autumn will be able to take course units online and cut the cost of tuition fees for a geography degree.\nPeter Horrocks, chairman of Futurelearn, described this as a \"breakthrough moment\".\nFuturelearn has been created by the Open University, a longstanding provider of degrees by distance learning.\nBut the big change will be if leading, campus-based universities begin to compete for mainstream, undergraduate courses online.\nAnother major US online university network, edX, is launching a project this autumn allowing online course units to be used as building blocks towards a full degree.\nEdX is offering a range of online courses from Arizona State University - and if a student passes eight of these, costing $200 (Â£150) each, it counts as the equivalent of a first year at university.\nCoursera has launched two online postgraduate courses with the University of Illinois, at a much lower price than their conventional counterparts.\nProf Koller says the past four years has seen a rapid rise in the numbers of students wanting to study online, but a slower reaction from universities in offering fully fledged online courses.\n\"We thought that the change in academic institutions would be more rapid,\" she said. \"Universities are not the most nimble of organisations.\"\nThat change could now be approaching, she says, with universities working out their strategies for a potentially huge market.\nThe hype around Moocs might have faded, but the big impact could be about to begin.",

It's simply not effective.\"\nBreeds banned by the act are pit bull terriers, the Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and fila Brasileiro, types that have traditionally been bred for fighting.\nThe act also makes it an offence for an owner to allow any dog \"to be dangerously out of control\".\nMr Rosindell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had long argued that the problem is not with the dogs but their owners.\n\"There are lots of breeds of dogs that can be just as dangerous as the ones listed in the Dangerous Dogs Act so to get rid of this legislation to replace it with a more flexible form of regulation means that the police and local authorities could then focus on where there is a known dangerous dog or an irresponsible owner,\" he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.\n\"It is impossible for authorities to check every single dog [and owner]... but certainly if there's one incident then that dog and that owner would then have to be checked and warned, and if there's a second incident, then the authorities may want to take action.\n\"The dog is like a human being almost. If you treat it badly, if you train it to do bad things, if you torment it, it will become aggressive.\n\"The problem is they only really have powers to act on those four breeds so they waste a lot of time on dogs that aren't dangerous instead of dealing with the ones that are.\"\nJust days before Dexter's death, David Ellam, 52, from Huddersfield, was attacked and killed by a dog which had been returned to its owner despite concerns that it was dangerous.\nAfter his death, Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said she believed the act was \"completely flawed\".\n\"We've been given the idea that we are all secure because the Dangerous Dogs Act has vilified a certain type of dog and therefore, as long as they're illegal, we're all safe,\" she said.\n\"Any dog can be dangerous if it is wrongly handled and wrongly trained.\"\nThe Dangerous Dogs Act has been amended over time.\nIn 2014, sentencing guidelines in England and Wales were changed to raise the maximum jail sentence for a fatal dog attack from two years to 14.\nThe law was also extended to include attacks which happen on private property and the police and authorities were given powers to require owners to attend dog training classes or muzzle their dog in public.\nA spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \"Any dog can become dangerous if it is kept by irresponsible owners in the wrong environment which is why the Dangerous Dogs Act covers any type of dog that is dangerously out of control.\"",

Both officers were seated in their cars and were shot while they were sitting.\"\nA mobile phone video posted under Mr Greene's name in October shows a man complaining to police that a group of black people had hit him and taken from him a Confederate flag he was holding during a high school sports event.\nThe Confederate flag is widely seen as a symbol of slavery.

There were no injuries of any officers or Mr Green during the arrest.\"\nIowa Governor Terry Branstad said in a statement that the killings were \"an attack on the public safety of all Iowans\".\nUS Attorney General Loretta Lynch said: \"Violence has no place in the United States of America.\n\"And when that violence is coldly and deliberately directed at those who risk their lives to enforce the law and to keep us safe, it is especially intolerable.\n\"This tragic incident is yet another reminder of the tremendous dangers that law enforcement officers face each and every day.

    "document": "The Italian's first season in charge, following an appointment greeted with a wave of indifference, ended with a success that defied history, logic, the odds and the game's natural financial order, as he turned a Leicester team that narrowly avoided relegation into champions.\nThe day Ranieri, in a stadium cloaked dramatically in storm clouds but fuelled by undiluted emotion, led blind tenor Andrea Bocelli to the centre circle to start the title celebrations seemed an age away as Leicester brutally sacked the man who gave the club its greatest moment.\nSo how has football's greatest fairytale descended into a nightmare in just nine months?\nIt is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title.\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, a former Leicester and England striker, tweeted: \"After all that Claudio Ranieri has done for Leicester City, to sack him now is inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad.\"\nLineker echoed the thoughts of the majority who aired their views publicly - but is there actually method in what many see at the madness of the club's Thai owners?\nLeicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday.\nAfter 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season.\nThe difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous.\nThe clear and present danger was the threat of relegation, as stated by vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha when he said: \"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign.\"\nWould Leicester fans have thanked the board for being sentimental all the way into the Championship? Cut away the romance, sentimentality and the memories of last season and they will feel this decision has been taken to stave off the most dramatic fall of any Premier League champions.\nIt will still, however, be a very hard sell given Ranieri's history-making effort last season.\nNo manager can ever be unsackable - but Ranieri's reserve of credit was as close to limitless as it gets after performing a sporting miracle to win the title last season.\nIt is the second season in succession a Premier League-winning manager has failed to survive the following campaign. Jose Mourinho was sacked by Chelsea after he was a champion in 2015.\nMourinho, however, was at a club with a high turnover of managers that had enjoyed huge successes - he had not pulled perennial strugglers from near the bottom to top of the table in the blink of an eye.\nPlenty will regard Leicester's treatment of Ranieri as a cut-throat act from an ownership who should wake up and give him thanks every day for giving them a success and a story they would have regarded as fantasy when they appointed him.\nRanieri took Leicester from 14th to first with a style built on solid defence, fierce organisation and a thrilling counter-attacking style based around Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. He was the master man-manager, taking all the pressure and letting his players fly.\nThere is no doubt there is some real unease among Leicester's fans about Ranieri's sacking, and how it reflects on the image of the club supported so fervently by neutrals - and just about any club that could not win the title - last season. Leicester were having relegation wished on them on social media on Thursday by those whose hearts they won last year.\nThe manner in which Ranieri has been shown off the premises has prompted questions about basic loyalty and decency in football, and how a manager who made Leicester a worldwide feelgood sports story can be treated in such a way.\nAnd surely his success last season proved he could still keep Leicester in the Premier League?\nRanieri is experienced, up for the fight and had a reservoir of goodwill last season to call on.\nSadly for this most amiable and classy of men, the reservoir ran dry on Thursday.\nThe vote of confidence is always regarded as 'dreaded' - but Leicester's for Ranieri may come to be known as notorious.\nIt was on 7 February, 16 days before the axe fell, and after a 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United, that they announced \"unwavering support\" for the Italian, stressing boardroom loyalty further by adding \"the unprecedented success achieved in recent seasons has been based firmly on stability, togetherness and determination to overcome even the greatest of challenges\".\nSo what has happened since to effect such a change?\nLeicester beat Derby in an FA Cup fourth-round replay the following day but then turned in a dreadful display to lose 2-0 at relegation rivals Swansea before going out of the FA Cup with an under-strength team at League One Millwall.\nA Champions League last-16 loss at La Liga powerhouses Sevilla was a relatively acceptable result but the performance was poor - were Leicester's owners simply seeing no signs of improvement?\nGrim reality, not to mention fear, may also have descended on the boardroom at the sight of Hull City showing progress under Marco Silva as the club felt the cold hand of relegation on its shoulder.\nWhat is clear is something has changed dramatically, and it is the ominous prospect of going from champions to Championship in 12 months.\nLeicester's players would have done well to avoid social media after news emerged of Ranieri's sacking. There was widespread sympathy for the manager and scathing criticism for the players whose standards have fallen through the floor.\nSomething has been amiss from day one this season after a summer of big new contracts for the title winners and one very crucial departure.\nJamie Vardy, top scorer with 24 goals last season, rejected a £22m summer move to Arsenal to sign a lucrative new four-year deal. The Gunners may regard this as a bullet dodged as he has scored only five league goals this season, including a hat-trick in the 4-2 win against Manchester City.\nPFA Player of the Year Riyad Mahrez, coveted across Europe, signed a four-year contract, while goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, wanted by Everton, signed a five-year deal along with midfielder Danny Drinkwater.\nMahrez scored 17 league goals last season but has contributed only three this term, while Drinkwater has failed to reproduce the form that earned him an England call-up.\nLeicester's players appear to have lost the hunger, as well as the element of surprise, that enabled them to climb the mountain last season.\nAnd in some cases, such as captain Wes Morgan and Robert Huth, they have simply reverted to the workaday Premier League central defenders they were before they were carried along with an unstoppable momentum last season.\nThere has also been sniping behind the scenes that has not helped Ranieri, with whispers emanating from inside the camp that he had become distant from his backroom staff amid growing unrest from his management team and players.\nThe same stories came out about Ranieri's tactical approach - giving the impression the players were happy to take the acclaim last season but were only too willing to point the finger of blame at their manager after it went wrong.\nHe was also subjected to a public attack from striker Leonardo Ulloa, who accused Ranieri of betrayal as a move to Sunderland was falling through.\nIf these players have been using Ranieri as a shield for their own shortcomings, then this has been removed. They now have no excuses or scapegoat.\nAnd yet the biggest factor of all may be a player who is no longer at Leicester.\nN'Golo Kante, Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year last season, took his relentless tackling, work-rate and guile to Chelsea in the summer in a £32m deal. The Foxes have never been the same - whereas he is on course for another title at Stamford Bridge.\nOnce the shockwaves have subsided, Ranieri will be remembered as the manager who gave Leicester, the city and the football club, its greatest sporting moment. He made Leicester a worldwide good news story.\nHe will be remembered as a man of manners and dignity but with a steel behind the smile that enabled him to lead the Foxes to perhaps the most unlikely triumph in British sport.\nRanieri will also be remembered by many as someone who was treated shabbily and without gratitude at the end - an example of how sentiment will never exist in football.\nIn the final analysis, though, he will remembered at Leicester as a good man who performed a great feat. And will be remembered forever.\nIt must be assumed Leicester's owners have a new man in mind to make such a seismic move as sacking Ranieri.\nCombustible former manager Nigel Pearson was even linked with a return, but one live contender appears to be Ranieri's compatriot Roberto Mancini.\nHe is available, had a short spell as a Leicester player in 2001 and has Premier League experience as a manager. Mancini led Manchester City from December 2009 to May 2013, winning the FA Cup in 2011 and their first title in 44 years 12 months later.\nWhoever is next, the first priority is safety rather than emulating Ranieri's title-winning feats.",

    "document": "The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history.\nAlmost all of the pro-European \"big beasts\" of the Thatcher/Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics.\nAccording to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether.\nThe estimate of more than a hundred outright \"withdrawalists\" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe.\nOnly ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the \"Better Off Out\" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal.\nToday Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water.\nThat impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity.\nOne of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now \"mainstream\" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as \"the love that dare not speak its name\".\nThe other complained of a \"supine approach\" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government.\nWhen the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as \"no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum\".\nThe Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise.\n\"The collateral damage from that broken promise\", our un-nameable MP said, \"is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now\".\nCould the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg?\nThere are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too.\nLast year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour.\nMr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop \"the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries\".\nThat theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband.\nMaurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies.\nHe told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause.\nAll these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again.\nAnd the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe.\nDouglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership:\n\"Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc\", he says, \"we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.\"\nBut Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.\nTory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.\nThere is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.\n\"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis\", says Tim Montgomerie, \"every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.\"\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST\nDownload the Analysis podcast\nListen via the Radio 4 website\nFollow Analysis on Facebook\nLast month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.\nThe meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for \"new thinking\" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.\nOne of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described \"this in-or-out discussion\" as \"a bit crude\", and said she thinks the choice is between \"the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship\".\nThe wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.\nAlmost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.\nThat in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.\nFormer Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply \"wave goodbye\" altogether.\nAnd Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.\nIt is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.\nThose MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October at 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST.

Their relationship seemed perfect.\nHe is known as the \"blade runner\" because of the carbon fibre prosthetic blades he races in. He was born without a fibula in both legs and had his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday.\nPolice were called to his home in the upmarket Silver Woods gated compound on the outskirts of South Africa's administrative capital in the early hours of Thursday morning.\nThey found paramedics treating a 29-year-old woman with four gunshot wounds to the head and upper body. She died at the scene, and officers recovered a 9mm pistol.\nEarly reports suggested Mr Pistorius might have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder.\nPolice say neighbours heard screaming and shouting around the time of the shooting, and that they had been called to investigate incidents of a domestic nature at the same house in the past.\nThey also said that they would oppose any bail application.\nHours later, after being questioned by police, Mr Pistorius left a police station accompanied by officers, his face mostly covered by the hood of a grey jacket.\nHis court hearing was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon but had been postponed until Friday to give forensic investigators time to carry out their work, said Medupe Simasiku, a spokesman for the prosecution.\nMr Pistorius's father, Henke, declined to comment but said: \"We all pray for guidance and strength for Oscar and the lady's parents.''\nMiss Steenkamp's publicist confirmed to the BBC that the 29-year-old model had died.\n\"Everyone who knew her is in tears. She was an absolute angel, the sweetest, sweetest human being, a kind human being,\" Sarit Tomlinson said.\nIn her last Twitter messages, Miss Steenkamp had spoken about her excitement about Valentine's Day.\n\"What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?'' she tweeted. \"It should be a day of love for everyone.''\nMr Pistorius dominated in his category at successive Paralympic Games, but in 2008 he won a legal battle over his blades - which critics said gave him an unfair advantage - with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)  for the right to compete in able-bodied competitions.\nOscar Pistorius profile\nReaction: Pistorius shooting\nHe reached the 400m semi-finals in the London 2012 Olympics.

    "document": "That's the conclusion of a study that suggests a fourfold rise in the amount of mineral and organic phosphorus needed on grasslands by 2050.\nThe researchers say that at present, more phosphorus is being lost from soils than is being added by farmers.\nBut there are concerns that increases in the use of the mineral could damage the environment.\nPhosphorus is an irreplaceable element for all life forms - but it is only since the 19th century that humans have been systematically using it to boost agricultural production.\nThe mineral can be mined as phosphate ore - but animal excrement is also an important source especially in the developing world.\nDemand grew so rapidly over the 20th century that there were concerns about overuse and \"peak phosphorus\".\nBut research published in 2012, looking at the need for phosphorus on crops, suggested that future demand could be met from existing sources.\nThis new study though looks at the use of phosphorus on grasslands which cover around a quarter of the Earth's ice-free land areas.\nThese fields are crucial are in the production of milk and meat. As global incomes rise, demand for these products is set to soar. This in turn will spark a rise in demand grass crops and production is expected to increase by 80% by 2050.\nBut the study points out that at present, the vast majority of grasslands in the world are losing more phosphorus than they are gaining.\nThe losses are mainly caused by farmers collecting manure from grasslands and using it to fertilise croplands. The amount being lost from intensive farming is far greater than from pastoral systems. Between 1970 and 2005, 44% of these losses occurred in Asia.\n\"This is one main factor,\" said Prof Martin van Ittersum, a co-author of the study from the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands.\n\"Of all the manure that is deposited on the grassland, half of it is taken away for croplands or used for fuel or for plastering the walls of the houses in Africa.  The fact is that the grasslands are not fertilised, so you have very little inputs to the system.\"\nThe researchers say that to meet the projected demand for grassland in 2050, the amounts of phosphorus used will have to grow more than fourfold from 2005 levels.\nTo cope with both grassland and arable land demands, the overall use of mineral phosphorus fertiliser must double by the middle of the century.\n\"It is a vast area but that is very significant, yes,\" said Prof van Ittersum.\n\"It is our strong assumption, that productivity will decrease and the pressure on our feed crops will increase and that is something that we should avoid,\" he said.\n\"There is already a societal concern that we are feeding too much of our cereal crops to livestock and that pressure will only increase if our grasslands decrease in productivity.\"\nBut increasing the amount of phosphorus used on land, especially in mineral form, carries significant environmental concerns.\nExcessive use of fertilisers of all types can lead to a leaching of nutrients into the sea where they have created so-called \"dead zones\".\n\"A fourfold rise in phosphorus use would have a big impact on the environment, especially on marine life,\" said Marissa de Boer who is European Project Manager of SusPhos at VU University in Amsterdam.\n\"The leaching of phosphorus from agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea leads to uncontrolled algae growth and dead zones such as the ones found in the Baltic Sea, Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico. This is an effect of increased fertilizer use in the past half century.\nWhat would the effect be if we now increase phosphorus use fourfold?\"\nProf van Ittersum says these issues can be controlled. The most important thing is awareness.\n\"We are still talking about modest amounts, I don't think the environmental risks are particularly big,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We have to do it carefully, we have to reuse our residues and wastes and make sure as little phosphorus as possible ends up in our sewage systems.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal, Nature Communications.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook.",

One man died after being shot by an unidentified gunman in the southern city of Antakya.\nAnother died after being hit by a car that ploughed into a crowd in Istanbul.\nThe Turkish Human Rights Association, an NGO, said more than 2,800 protesters had been injured across the country, many of them seriously, and that 791 had been detained, of whom \"around 500\" have since been released.\nMr Arinc said that 244 police officers and 64 protesters had been injured, and more than 70m Turkish lira (Â£24m; $37m) worth of public damage had been caused.\nProtesters accuse the Turkish government of becoming increasingly authoritarian.\nMr Erdogan is still the most popular politician in the country, but he is discovering that a ruling style that his opponents say is autocratic has its limits, the BBC's Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen reports from Istanbul.\nMr Erdogan's Turkey was seen as a runaway success by many in Europe and the Middle East; now it is looking tarnished, with deeper problems than its allies - and enemies - realised, he adds.",

Women's football in England is now worthy of that stage and as one of the first two teams to play this historic occasion, we will be proud to be part of another pioneering moment.\nIn the build-up to the game, some of my team-mates have been asking me about playing at Wembley, having played there for England against Germany last November and while representing Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics.\nI can only say that it is a unique, out-of-body experience to play in front of so many people. It's a feeling that never gets old and we will be going to Wembley before Saturday so that those new to it can get a feel of the iconic 90,000-seat stadium.\nIn attempting to win Chelsea's first piece of silverware, it's the biggest game in the club's history, but one thing I've been telling them is we have to play the game and not the occasion.\nI wouldn't care if it was being played in a local park in Wembley, the most important thing is to win.\nWith Chelsea's men's team also playing at Wembley the following day when the Premier League champions take on FA Cup winners Arsenal in the Community Shield, we want to make it a historic weekend.\nThere are many players in our team who have won the FA Cup before, including myself.\nThe first time was in 2005 with Charlton when I scored the winner against Everton and in 2012 I was part of the Birmingham team which beat Chelsea on penalties following a 2-2 draw.\nIn our dressing room we have midfielder Katie Chapman, who has won the FA Cup eight times, and Gilly Flaherty, who has won it five times, so we are not lacking pedigree.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut having missed out on WSL so narrowly last season [on goal difference to Liverpool], it's fair to say that this could mean more because of the journey we have been on together.\nDespite losing our last two league games, we aren't panicking.

Despite the result, our performance was pleasing.\nWe are a point off the top with five games left and to be in that position in such a competitive season is positive.\nOur focus is now on Saturday and we are confident we can win.\nAnother positive from the World Cup has been the boost to crowds in the WSL.\nThe first weekend after we arrived back saw record numbers for Manchester City, while 2,061 watched Liverpool beat Arsenal, and more than 1,200 saw us beat Bristol.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThree weeks after our return, the bounce has lasted. Our first home defeat in more than 18 months by Manchester City was watched by a club-record 1,857 at Staines FC.\nThose numbers are a credit to marketing staff at WSL clubs and the players, who are obviously putting on a good show in order to entice supporters back. The time we spend with fans immediately after games also helps too, I think.\nThe test now comes when the Premier League starts on 8 August.\nWith the Continental Cup now under way again, our season doesn't end until October, so hopefully the upsurge in attendances will continue and women's football will still very much be something people want to watch.\nEngland and Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko was speaking to BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan.",

The other guys have all put in performances throughout this tour.\"\nMeanwhile, spin bowler Moeen Ali will drop back down to number eight after covering as an opener against Pakistan, and Jonny Bairstow, who played in the Ashes as a specialist batsman, will retain the wicketkeeping gloves following the dropping of Jos Buttler midway through the Pakistan series.\nJoe Root has recovered from his stomach illness and will be fit to play. James Taylor continues at number five, but there will be a new-look top three, with Nick Compton poised to play behind Hales and Cook in place of Ian Bell.\nWhile Nottinghamshire's Hales averages only 38 in first-class cricket, he is the only England batsman to have scored hundreds in Twenty20 and one-day internationals, and also made a half-century in the warm-up match against South Africa A.\nHowever, England will face Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel - probably the world's best new-ball pair - on pace-friendly pitches with a top eight where none except Cook and Joe Root have played more than 20 Tests.\nA formidable South Africa side that went nine years and 30 Test series with only two defeats is now also in a state of transition.\nFinding a replacement for all-rounder Jacques Kallis, who retired in 2013, was always likely to be difficult, but the Proteas have also struggled at the top of the order since former captain Graeme Smith quit the following year.\nIt was the batting which failed the Proteas in India, prompting Hashim Amla's side into a reshuffle of their own.\n\"Opening the batting is the most difficult job in Test cricket,\" Amla said. \"Dean Elgar has been very good for us, and Stiaan van Zyl has got the full potential to be a great opener for us.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"It was a tough tour for the openers in India, but then again it was a tough tour for all the batters.\"\nMost significantly, AB de Villiers has been asked to keep wicket in order to find space for another batsman.\nDe Villiers is ranked as the third best Test batsman in the world and Amla seventh, but England will be targeting the rest of a top seven that is either inexperienced or out of form.\nThe home side are boosted by Steyn's recovery from a groin injury, but Vernon Philander is out with an ankle problem.\n\"The way Dale has been bowling in the nets has been unbelievable,\" Amla said. \"He's been the best bowler in the world for many years. We're really glad to have him back.\"\nEngland have visited South Africa four times since the Proteas returned to the international fold, with each tour proving memorable for a variety of reasons.\nEngland's 1-0 defeat in 1995-96 was the tour in which Michael Atherton batted for nearly 11 hours to earn a draw in Johannesburg, while South Africa's 2-1 win four years later included the 'leather jacket Test', when disgraced former Proteas captain Hansie Cronje was paid to corruptly ensure that the fifth Test did not end in a draw.\nIn 2004-05, Michael Vaughan's England secured a 2-1 win that preceded their Ashes triumph, while the one-day leg of the trip saw Kevin Pietersen score three centuries despite abuse from the crowds in the country of his birth.\nSix years ago, on England's most recent South Africa tour, they escaped with a 1-1 series draw after number 11 Graham Onions twice saw off the final over of the match to earn two draws.\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew\n\"There's no question England are confident of pulling off their second unexpected success of the year, but they will have to bat better than they did while winning the Ashes.\n\"The batting is the battleground of the series, with South Africa's line-up losing a lot of confidence in their defeat in India, which resulted in both frontline spinners being dropped and AB de Villiers returning to keep wicket.\n\"England also came unstuck against Pakistan but both teams will prefer the conditions that await them in these four Tests.\n\"South Africa's pace attack will target Alex Hales, who has to prove he has the technique and temperament to cope with high-class new-ball bowling. If he fails, Nick Compton will move quickly from three to opener.\n\"The pace bowling of both teams will be challenging and exciting and it will be the batting line-up that deals with it the best that will ultimately prevail.\"\nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss: \"It's been a good 12 days that we've been here. It was good to see our top four guys score runs.\n\"To be successful in this series, the top four guys are going to have to play very well so it's good for them to spend some time in the middle leading up to this first Test.\n\"Everyone has scored some runs and taken some wickets so, preparation-wise, it's as good as we could have hoped for getting ready to play the number one team in the world.\"\nSouth Africa (from): Hashim Amla (capt), AB de Villiers (wk), Kyle Abbott, Temba Bavuma, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Dean Elgar, Morne Morkel, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Dale Steyn, Stiaan van Zyl.\nEngland: Alastair Cook (capt), Alex Hales, Nick Compton, Joe Root, James Taylor, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn.",

    "document": "It began on Friday when Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the southern Russian republic, labelled opponents of President Vladimir Putin \"enemies of the people\" and called for such \"traitors\" to be prosecuted for subversion, claiming they were working in league with the West.\nMr Kadyrov has now re-asserted his claims and gone even further in an online editorial for pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia.\nReferring to a \"half-witted rabble\", he offered opposition activists the services of a Chechen psychiatric hospital to treat their \"mass psychosis\".\n\"I promise we won't spare the injections. We can do double,\" he wrote.\nA boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled \"foot soldier\" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly.\nHuman rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a \"true patriot\".\nThis time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve.\nThe most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the \"shame of Russia\".\n\"Why don't you get lost?\" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let \"normal, honest people\" work for the good of the country.\nBut the Siberian was soon eating his \"hasty\" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his \"discourtesy\", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya.\nCartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head.\nIn an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his \"emotional outburst\".\nActivists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia.\nWell-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan \"for existing\".\nOne was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram.\nMeanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism.\nBut the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader.\nNone has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were \"itching\" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into.\n\"Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him,\" wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. \"Just imagine what would happenâ€¦ If it weren't forâ€¦ Democracy.\"\nThere is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow.\nBut the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions.\nParliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest.\n\"It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening,\" argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire.\n\"The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society,\" wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog.\nAnother commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop.\nWhatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder.\nA year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife.\nRamzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat.\n\"The situation is very tense now,\" Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems.\nThat concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader.\n\"Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads,\" he warned.  \"So we need to be careful.\"",

I thoroughly enjoyed the trip,\" Mr Davidson told the BBC News website.\n\"It was a grand motor car and he's done a magnificent job restoring it. The paintwork is in its original colours. The interior is all original. He tried to get me to drive it - but I said 'I'd better not!'\"\nMr Davidson had first come across the car at an old coachbuilders in Elgin while working at his father's garage following his National Service in 1954.\nIt was under a dustsheet and he asked the owner if he could buy it.\n\"He said 'No laddie, I'm not selling it',\" Mr Davidson said. \"I asked him again eight weeks later. This went on for two years. Eventually he said I could have it and he asked how much I had in my pocket. I got it for Â£15 which was a bargain.\"\nMr Davidson restored the car and in 1959 entered it in the Kildrummy Rally, where vehicles travelled from Kildrummy to Aberdeen. He won the vintage class.\n\"I was the only kilted competitor,\" he said.\nEventually, Mr Davidson's father sold his garage and he had nowhere to keep the car so it had to go.\n\"I sold the car to a man from RAF Kinloss or Lossiemouth for Â£185,\" Mr Davidson recalled. \"I watched him drive away and put it completely out of my mind. That was the last I saw of it until Robin got in touch 55-60 years later.\n\"I was very surprised when he got in touch and I am delighted that I'm going to see the car again.\"\nMr Wills' father bought the car in about 1965 but sold it to a Newcastle car dealer in 1974, when Mr Wills was aged four.\nThe next time Mr Wills saw it, it was when it appeared in the opening credits of the 1976 Likely Lads film.\n\"It's unique because it has an owl on the front, on the top of the radiator,\" he said. \"So I knew it was the same car.\"\nMr Wills' research, which took two years, revealed that the car was later bought by a man who took it to America and it had crossed the Atlantic four times.\nIt was also owned by the man's brother, Lotus designer Martin Waide.\nHowever, after its engine blew up in 1979 it was never driven again until Mr Wills brought it back to its former glory.\n\"I used to talk to my dad about the car in my teenage years as I had fond memories of it,\" he said. \"I was delighted and astounded to find it. When I got it back the first thing I did was to open the door, shut my eyes and took a whiff.\n\"It has the original interior. It hasn't been touched in 98 years. The smell was astounding. It was as if I had been transported back to 1974.\"\nThe Humber had some plaques inside it relating to the Kildrummy Rally.\nMr Wills carried out an internet search and found footage of the rally, which included Mr Davidson and the car, on the National Library of Scotland's Moving Image Archive.\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" he said. \"It was as if someone had walked on my grave. It was an incredible experience.\"\nHe then managed to track Mr Davidson down.\n\"The sense of excitement in his voice was unbelievable,\" Mr Wills said. \"I think he was as excited as I was.\"\nThe two men discovered they had more in common than the Humber - they also shared the same birthday.\nFor Mr Davidson's 80th, Mr Wills sent him the car's original front number plate which the pensioner had made.\n\"I thought that was great,\" Mr Davidson said.\nThe journey to northern Scotland with the car on Saturday was wet at times, forcing Mr Wills to make an emergency stop to buy brass polish.\n\"I had to buff up the brasswork. I wanted it to look its best for Bert,\" he said.\n\"It's been an amazing experience. I feel a bit like Doctor Who, travelling back to meet characters from the past.\"\nThe Humber's owners, past and present, exchanged gifts - a photo album of the car and a bottle of whisky from Mr Davidson's home town of Elgin.",

    "document": "Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK imposed no migration controls on eight central European and Baltic nations joining the EU in 2004 and the new proposals would \"address the consequences\" of that.\nBut he said the emergency brake would only apply in \"exceptional cases\".\nEurosceptics say it is ineffectual and could make the situation worse.\nSpeaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a \"handbrake turn\" by David Cameron.\nThe prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later.\nHe has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately.\nBut many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive \"graduated\" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that.\nThey are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally.\nDefending the proposals and the rest of the draft deal in the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the entire package - which must be approved by the EU as a whole, was \"fair to the UK and fair to the other 27 EU states\".\nOn welfare, he said: \"We propose to create a safeguard mechanism tailor-made to the concerns of the UK, that would allow it to restrict the excess of EU workers newly entering its Labour market to in-work benefits in a graduated manner for a period of up to four years.\n\"The duration of the mechanism will be limited in time - that is a crucial characteristic of a safeguard mechanism, necessary to make it compatible with the (EU) treaties. It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should.\"\nMr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so.\nOne of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK.\nMr Juncker said \"as a result\" of that decision \"over the past decade, the UK attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens\". He added. \"In effect, we will enable the UK to use the safeguards mechanism to address the consequences of that decision.\"\nBut UKIP leader Nigel Farage, also speaking in the European Parliament, said the safeguards were totally insubstantial and would not allow the UK to reduce levels of annual net migration, which rose to 336,000 in the year to June 2015.\n\"We have an emergency brake on migrants benefits. Wow. It was supposed to be a total ban on migrants benefits for four years. So it is hardly an emergency brake, it is more of a handbrake turn.\"\nMr Farage said Mr Cameron would not be able to get any further concessions out of the EU and the forthcoming referendum on the UK's future in the EU would be a battle between \"vested self-interests and people power\".\nFormer Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is now a leading MEP, suggested that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be a boost for Russia and China.\n\"I think Britain without Europe - ok it's a dwarf, let's be honest,\" he claimed.\n\"We Belgians, we know that we are dwarfs but maybe they're going to know it also. And at the other hand Europe without Great Britain, yes, doesn't count, is not a counterweight against China, against Russia, against the United States.\n\"It is Vladimir Putin, in fact, who wins in this game in the end because Putin likes a divided Europe.\"",

    "document": "A working reactor caught fire, explosively. Radioactive debris was sent 30,000 feet into the air - the height at which airliners conventionally fly.\nSome of that debris came down thousands of kilometres away, in concentrations strong enough to prohibit the eating of meat and the drinking of milk produced locally.\nThe upgrading of Japan's Fukushima incident to a level seven - the maximum - on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) puts it on a par with Chernobyl.\nAnd a spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which runs the plant, suggested it could even end up being worse than Chernobyl.\nThis, though, appears to be a minority view among engineers - both those who generally support nuclear power, and those who have in the past voiced criticisms.\nTimeline: nuclear accidents\n\"The classification of seven means there's a leak of radiation into the wider environment; and although it'll be interpreted as being 'the same as Chernobyl', it's not the same,\" said Paddy Regan, professor of    physics at the UK's University of Surrey.\n\"The amount of radiation release is a lot less, and the way it's released is very different.\n\"The Chernobyl fire was putting lots of radioactive material into the atmosphere and taking it over large distances; here, there have been a couple of releases where they've vented [gas from] the reactor, and then released some cooling water.\"\nDon Higson, a retired Australian nuclear safety specialist, was more pithy.\n\"To my mind, [rating Fukushima equivalent to Chernobyl] would be nonsense,\" he said.\nIn the month following the Chernobyl explosion, he said, 134 workers were hospitalised with acute radiation sickness and 31 died.\nThe equivalent figures for Fukushima are none and none. (Although workers have been taken to hospital with radiation burns, this is not the same as acute radiation sickness.)\nSo why the uprating?\nWhat it does not mean is that things have got worse at the plant; in fact, conditions appear to be markedly more stable than in the days following the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, although not completely under control.\nRather, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) has re-analysed data from the incident and decided that collectively the releases of radioactivity mean it slots into a level seven categorisation.\nThe manual for agencies using the INES scale, published by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), runs to 218 pages.\nOne of the criteria for evaluating the severity of an incident is the total release of radioactive material.\nThis is derived by first adding up the amounts of each different radioactive isotope released, then multiplying each by a conversion factor related to the characteristics of that particular isotope, then adding up all of the resulting numbers.\nRadioactivity is measured in becquerels (Bq); a million million of these is a terabecquerel (TBq).\nA level seven rating is defined as \"An event resulting in an environmental release corresponding to a quantity of radioactivity radiologically equivalent to a release to the atmosphere of more than several tens of thousands of TBq of Iodine-131.\"\nNISA puts the Fukushima figure at 370,000 TBq of Iodine-131 equivalent; the Nuclear Safety Commission, which has a more over-arching role in the Japanese system, says 630,000 TBq.\nEither way, it's clearly beyond the threshold for classification as an INES level seven event, although an order of magnitude lower than the 5.2 million TBq released from Chernobyl.\nBut that tells you nothing about the danger to people.\nBecquerels are a measure of the rate of radioactive decay; if one atomic nucleus decays per second, that is defined as one becquerel.\nBy contrast, sieverts - another unit commonly used during the last month's reporting - measure the likely medical impact of the radiation to which an individual is exposed.\nAnd a huge number of becquerels does not automatically translate into a huge amount of sieverts.\n\"It's hard to make a comparison between Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima because the radioactive release is different and so is the population,\" said John Large, a UK-based independent nuclear engineer.\n\"In Ukraine and Belorussia (now Belarus) it was primarily a rural population, whereas in Japan you've got a highly sophisticated public living in fairly dense population groups.\n\"And the way the state intervenes is different. With Chernobyl, loads of workers were brought in with no concern for their health - but Japan's a democracy.\"\nIn some quarters, Japan's swift decision to establish an exclusion zone, initiate monitoring of people and food, and dispense iodine tablets has received praise - and the volume of advice and warnings issued to the public has been very different from the silence that pertained after Chernobyl, despite criticisms from other quarters over the quality and timing of some of the Japanese advice.\nNuclear experts are cautioning, however, that the situation at Fukushima is still very much in play.\nWhere most attention has centred on reactors 1, 2 and 3, there is also concern about the spent fuel pond in reactor building 4.\nIn the week following the tsunami, it became clear that the pond was running dry, meaning that fuel rods would have heated up.\nThis meant likely degradation of their zirconium alloy cladding, the possible release of hydrogen, and - by Tepco's admission - the risk that a nuclear chain reaction could begin.\n\"The potential for atmospheric release is very large, with 250 tonnes of material sitting in that pond,\" said Dr Large.\n\"If you were to have an energetic event you could have a very large release indeed.\"\nThe priority is, as it has been all along, to restore adequate coolant to the fuel ponds and the reactors themselves - while hoping that earthquake aftershocks and bad weather do not hamper operations any more.",

    "document": "Speaking to the New York Times, Mr Trump said the US would only come to the aid of allies if they have \"fulfilled their obligations to us\".\nMembers of Nato have all signed a treaty that says they will come to the aid of any member that is attacked.\nMr Trump will speak on Thursday at the Republican National Convention.\nIn a preview of what he will tell convention-goers in his speech, he outlined a foreign policy strategy aimed at reducing US expenditure and involvement abroad.\nWhat the world wants to know about Trump - Q&A from Cleveland\nAlthough the White House has not responded directly to Mr Trump's comments, spokesman Josh Earnest said on Thursday the US commitment to NATO was \"ironclad\".\nHe said potential enemies should not misjudge Washington's commitment to defend its NATO allies.\n\"The president renewed that commitment just two weeks ago today when he travelled to Warsaw, Poland, to attend the NATO summit.\"\nMr Trump's comments hit at the fundamental basis of the Atlantic alliance; that an attack on one ally is an attack on all.\nUnder Article 5 of Nato's founding treaty, allies are bound to come to the aid of a member under attack.\nThe US has long been pressing its European allies to spend more on defence. That is slowly beginning to have an effect.\nBut never has there been a suggestion that the US would renege on its responsibilities.\nHis comments on Turkey suggest that the Republican contender also seems reluctant to insist upon Nato members maintaining strong democratic principles.\nMr Trump's positions will be seen by Washington's Nato partners as at best eccentric and at worst alarming.\nAt a time of growing tensions with Moscow, the idea that the US might become an unreliable ally is a nightmare for Nato's European members.\nAsked about Russian aggression towards Nato countries in the Baltic region, Mr Trump suggested the US might abandon the longstanding protections offered by the US to such nations.\nThe divisive Republican candidate also said that, if elected, he would not pressure US allies over crackdowns on political opposition and civil liberties, arguing that the US had to \"fix our own mess\" before \"lecturing\" other nations.\nHe said: \"Look at what is happening in our country. How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?\"\nAsked about the failed coup in Turkey on Friday, the Republican candidate praised Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been criticised by some Western leaders over his increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\"I give great credit to him for being able to turn that around,\" Mr Trump said of the failed coup. \"Some people say that it was staged, you know that,\" he said. \"I don't think so.\"\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Mr Erdogan to follow the rule of law, amid a crackdown on opposition figures by the Turkish leader in the wake of the coup attempt. But Mr Trump chose not to make a similar statement.\n\"When the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don't think we are a very good messenger,\" he said.\nThe Republican candidate also said that he would reassess the costs to the US of longstanding defence treaties, potentially forcing allies to take on those costs.\nHe said he would \"prefer to be able to continue\" existing agreements - but not if he felt allies were taking advantage of the US.\nReferring to what he said were US trade losses, Mr Trump said: \"We are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800bn. That doesn't sound very smart to me.\"\nHe also suggested he would close US bases abroad. \"If we decide we have to defend the United States, we can always deploy\" from American soil, he said \"and it will be a lot less expensive\".\nMr Trump will address the convention on Thursday following speeches from his running mate, Governor Mike Pence and his wife Melania Trump.\nMrs Trump's speech caused embarrassment when journalists noticed that sections of the text appeared to have been copied directly from a speech given by Michelle Obama at the 2008 Democratic Convention.\nSenator Ted Cruz, who came second in the Republican primaries, was booed by convention-goers on Thursday after opting not to endorse Mr Trump in his speech.",

Contact the File on 4 team\nIn the West Midlands, the rate of allegations of corruption against BME officers is more than five times higher than the rate of allegations against white officers.\nThe authors of the report are calling for further research and say their findings suggest the problems identified are not limited to the three forces featured in the research.\nChief Constable of Bedfordshire Police Alfred Hitchcock, who is the Association of Chief Police Officers lead on equality, diversity and human rights, says he has not yet seen the internal report but says the data is \"worrying\".\nHe told the BBC he would be speaking to other chief officers about the matter, but defended the way internal complaints are dealt with.\n\"If there are matters relating to racist or improper behaviour, then those are investigated and people who are victims are treated as victims.\n\"The service is very keen to make sure that we deal properly and appropriately with all staff and by doing that we would hope that people see us as being fair with all, and that is the objective,\" he said.\nFile on 4's investigation also uncovered concerns about the slow progress forces have made in recruiting and promoting BME officers.\nThirteen years after the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry recommended increased numbers of black and ethnic minority officers, the latest Home Office figures show more BME officers are leaving the police than joining.\nIn 2010-11, 165 BME officers were recruited, but 204 left the service.\nMr Hitchcock blames government cuts on police funding which has led to a recruitment freeze and subsequently a dip in numbers, but acknowledges the police leadership must do more:\n\"If some people think that we've got this sorted I think they're living in a dream world. I think there is an awful lot of work for us still to do.\n\"There is a danger that we put an over-negative spin on where we've come in the last decade because actually we've made fantastic progress. But that doesn't mean we stop; that means we actually need to renew and re-energise.\"\nListen to the full report on File on 4 on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday, 5 June at 20:00 BST and Sunday 10 June at 17:00 BST.\nListen again via the Radio 4 website or download the File on 4 podcast.",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nOf his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine.\nWinning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable.\nAnd yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price.\nMurray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\nOpting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\nAlthough it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\nAs well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\nThough he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\nSo, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\nMurray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\nIt would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\nYet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\nHe has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\nThis year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\nHe claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\nBut perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\nThat may not be a concern much longer.\nMurray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\nIn fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\nNadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\nAnd then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device",

He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014.\nJemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign.\nThe New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as \"striking\" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network.\nA commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a \"victory over Islamophobia\", and says London is breaking new ground. \"The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think,\" it says.\nQatari daily Al-Sharq says: \"Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor.\"\nPakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe.\nWith the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that \"Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims\".\nHistory Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. \"Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim,\" he says.\nBaroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds.\n\"Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians\" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith.\nIn France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says \"two images of the United Kingdom\" faced each other in this election: The \"exemplary success story\" of Mr Khan's life and \"the billionaire's son\", Mr Goldsmith.\n\"In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility,\" she told the paper. \"It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side.\"\nFinally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.",

Sometimes I try things and it doesn't work and I've broken my ribs, my hand, dislocated shoulders in the gym but we get it right for the fight.\n\"One of the main things is his mindset at the minute. He claims he is obsessed and I ask 'What is he obsessed about?' I look at myself in the mirror and it is about beating me.\n\"I've lived simple. I've been training under the dark light so I can shine under the bright lights on April 29.\"\nJoshua had numerous incidents with the police as a youth, including being arrested for ABH, drug possession and being electronically tagged. He has previously stated that he would have been in jail were it not for boxing.\nBut Joshua said: \"I've had tougher times in the gym than I have had in any walk of life at the minute.\n\"I put myself through it and it is important to because I don't want to be star of the gym and then when I get to the fight it's like: 'I've never faced this type of warrior before.'\"\nAsked if this is the defining fight of his career, Joshua replied: \"It is one of them. If this was towards the end of my career, I would say: 'This is the defining fight that's going to write the history books.'\n\"But I've still got so many more years. I'm confident. I'm learning about myself, so this fight is, for me, one fight that I've got to take in my stride round by round and when I take that attitude the victory comes and we move on and there are so many other big fights in the UK.\"\nJoshua does not believe Klitschko has underestimated him, saying: \"He's coming game, he's coming ready, and the body does what the mind tells it. His mind seems to be in the right place so I'm in for a tough fight.\"\n\"I may not express myself flashing what I've done and telling everyone I'm the greatest,\" he said.\n\"Where we grew up, everyone was about making money, but low key, understated - you probably didn't want to get your house burgled!\n\"Who I am when I was 17 is who I am today, so not much has changed.\n\"You've got to add a bit of flavour. It's needed now and again, but it's got to be real because I don't take boxing as an act. This is way of expressing myself and being true to myself and there are kids watching so you've got to be mindful.\n\"If I was to be that type of person - loud and trashing tables - after a fight, I would still continue to be that way. What I notice about fighters is they act a certain way and once the fight has started they are hugging each other and are quiet.\n\"I'm just trying to be myself on camera, in the ring, outside of the ring and off camera.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAsked about being very accessible, Joshua says: \"It's part of boxing. It is good to lock yourself away but I'm a man of the people, it's no bother. As long as it doesn't make me late for training, I've no problem speaking to 100 people.\n\"I'm in the same flat that I've been in since 2011 - it's been a long time. I think I'll be one of those guys who will learn the piano, the violin, bungee jump and do all the things I didn't do when I was fighting.\n\"When I'm not fighting, I try to take a holiday and experience things, but when I'm fighting the simple life has worked and I don't try and change it.\"\n\"I was on the complete opposite end of healthy living before boxing, it's got me strong,\" he said.\n\"I'm a superhero to my little cousins. It's what it does for my family and my surname Joshua.\n\"People are proud to wear that name and I'm representing my family. It is nice to have kids supporting you. It's reaching out to a wider audience.\n\"I'm just a normal person. You have your good days, your bad days, you have road rage, everyone goes through it.\n\"You've just got to live by the job you do and if that's what comes with it I'd rather choose winning over anything.\"\nJoshua, who turned professional after winning gold at London 2012, said: \"When I first turned professional, no-one would touch me sponsorship-wise and no-one was really backing boxing.\n\"I say look at the characters of the sport, look at the individuals, get behind the gloves.\"\nHe praised fellow Brits Tyson Fury, who won the heavyweight title with a win over Klitschko in November 2015, Dillian Whyte, the WBC International heavyweight title holder, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight title holder David Price and Dereck Chisora, who challenged for the WBC heavyweight title in 2012.\n\"As I've been in the game, Fury won, Dillian, myself, Chisora the likes of Price, up-and-coming heavyweights and lighter weights - it's definitely brought more attention.\"\nAsked if he was worried about his mum watching his fights, Joshua answers: \"No, no, no, definitely not. Because she's proud, she's happy and I look after her so I think that's the main thing.\n\"I've got a son and I definitely wouldn't want him to fight because of those reasons, his health, it's tough.\n\"I did it quietly. When I first started fighting, I didn't tell my family. It was just about me and what I wanted to do.\n\"My mum has always seen the positive light of fighting rather than the health issues and I've always been on the road to winning and glory.\n\"She's had a few tough times and a few scares when I've lost as an amateur, but we bounce back, and for all the good times she's forgot about the bad times we've had.\"",

And scientists are finding more evidence to suggest that even biological sex is a spectrum.\nDo we need to re-imagine our binary world and rethink one of the most basic parts of our identity?\nFour experts talk to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme.\nBrin Bixby was brought up as a boy, and went on to get married and father children before coming out as bigender. She set up Bigender.net, which reflects the view that gender is a spectrum.\n\"In college I wore a dress on Halloween, and it was supposed to be a joke, and the people helping me thought it was going to be hyper-real, exaggerated. [But] I didn't want to be a drag queen, I wanted to be a woman, and I think it took people by surprise.\n\"It was the first time I looked in the mirror and saw myself. People interacted with me as a woman: they saw me the way I wanted them to.\n\"I would be most comfortable if I didn't have to think about my gender, but unfortunately that's not how it works for me and a lot of other non-binary people.\n\"We have a cultural understanding of what gender is and looks like, and in the west we have a very binary view of it. My sense of gender as a part of my identity shifts.\n\"I present as a woman everywhere I go, except for at work and at my children's school, because it gets very exhausting to have to explain gender fluidity to everyone I meet.\n\"Ideally we would not make gender such a huge focus of our culture, which would give people the freedom to inhabit their gender in ways that feels most comfortable to them.\n\"What we're seeing now is a relaxation of the sense of binary amongst younger people and internet-savvy people who are inhabiting much more fluid spaces.\"\nWriter Mark Gevisser explores gender identities across different cultures.\n\"We know there's a gender continuum, because there have always been effeminate boys and masculine girls. Transgender is certainly not a western phenomenon. In many cultures all over the world there are traditionally third gender or gender-fluid identities.\n\"There are the Hijras in India, what are known as two-spirited people in Native American culture, Muxe in Mexico, and the Bakla in the Philippines. The space these people have occupied has receded with the spread of the Judeo-Christian ethic and western culture, but they're still very much there.\n\"There's a tendency in the west to idealise these. But the truth is that if you're Bakla or two-spirited, there are only certain things in your culture you can do. In India, the Hijras are basically cast out of society, only good for begging and sex work. So it's not necessarily a great life.\n\"I was talking to a remarkable gender therapist named Diane [Erinsaft] and I suddenly started worrying that if she'd been around when I was a little boy, I might have been turned into a little girl. She laughed and said 'No, you're definitely a guy'.\n\"But we started talking about the potential risk of the transgender movement establishing new binaries where, if you have a girly boy, and you're worried about how effeminate this child is, you could very easily solve the problem by taking the child to the doctor and the doctor can wave a wand and say 'Your girly boy is now a princess'.\n\"Wouldn't it be better if we had a society that just raised children so that it was okay to be a tomboyish girl, or a girly boy, and to explore that?\n\"Diane speaks about 'gender smoothies'; she got this from one of her patients who said 'I'm not a girl or a boy, I'm a gender smoothie, I mix it all up together'.\"\nDr Imran Mushtaq is a consultant paediatric urologist who works with children with differences in sex development (DDS) at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Around 1 in 1500 babies are born with DDS but up to 1 in 100 people have less obvious differences.\n\"Absolutely sex is a spectrum.  It's not binary in any way and we are slowly coming to understand this.\n\"As a specialist working in this area for the last 12 years, I've seen us transitioning so much in the way we think about sex and the way we treat children in whom the sex is not clear, and we are increasingly becoming aware how complex the issue is.\n\"How do you define what sex a child is? Is it the physical characteristics, the genitalia - do they have testicles, do they have ovaries or do they have both? Is it their chromosomes, is it their hormones?\n\"You can have a child whose chromosomes are XX, typical of what you'd associate with being female, yet their genitalia looks like a boy.\n\"Ten or 20 years ago when children were born with these kind of problems, there was very little discussion about not doing surgery.  It was almost a given that the child would need surgery to make it a boy or a girl.\n\"As a doctor and surgeon, I'm increasingly uncomfortable about undertaking what is irreversible surgery.\n\"We know that the outcomes of surgeries that were undertaken 10, 20 years ago are not necessarily as good as we would like them to be. Now is the next stage: in 10 or 20 years' time we will find out the outcome of not doing the surgery or maintaining these children in a certain sex, whereas previously they would have been changed to a different sex.\n\"I don't think we should have gender categories. I don't think that sex should be on birth certificates, I don't think sex should be on driving licences and I don't think sex should be on passports.\n\"We are just what we are. We have a name, we have a date of birth, give us a number.\"\nTamara Adrian is Venezuela's first transgender congresswoman although since it has not been possible legally to change your gender in Venezuela since 1998, she was sworn in under her old name, as a man.\n\"I've been saying for more than 15 years that gender as a legal category must be suppressed, because it is a way to deny rights or grant rights to male or female. Gender has the same effect that race or religion had in the past: there were two groups, one that was privileged and had rights, another that was underprivileged and didn't have rights.\n\"It is exactly the same with gender. If you are male, you have rights that females don't have, and this legal category of male and female is still being used to prevent equal rights: for instance, when you advertise a job and ask for someone you say female or male.\n\"I think [the idea of a legal third gender] will be the first test for this future solution in which gender will be suppressed in the legal document.\n\"It could be a solution because initially some of the [gender fluid] people in Nepal or India or Pakistan were not able to legally exist. They were not able to vote or go to school, and in general they were deprived of any basic rights. So it is an alternative in these countries.\n\"In other countries such as Australia which do not categorise a person within the male or female boxes, it's the first step in order to have a much more gender fluid world. But in Australia, for instance, they are allowing people to choose not to be considered legally male or female.  But in those cases, you are deprived of the right of marriage.\n\"We see a little of the possibility [of a less binary future] when you talk about a metrosexual man, or you see women that allow themselves a suit one day and the following day to use a dress with high heels.\n\"That's part of this gender fluid world in which you are not prevented to use the clothes that you want or to express your gender in the way you want.\"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT.

    "document": "It could be over in hours - or it could take weeks.\nThat's how unknowable an acute counter-terrorism investigation can be for MI5 and the police.\nWhile there is a sense that there has been significant headway in the last 24 hours, we should be careful about reading too much, too soon, into how long it will take Greater Manchester Police and their colleagues to be sure they have dealt with every single possible lead after Monday's events.\nIn recent years, we've got a greater understanding of how the more secretive end of these massive operations play out.\nAt any one time, MI5 is handling in the region of 500 active investigations involving 3,000 \"SOIs\" - \"subjects of interest\" in security world jargon.\nWhat kind of resources does MI5 have to throw at those targets? There are around 4,000 people at MI5.\nQuite obviously, they are not all trained in hiding in the bushes, so it would be fanciful in the extreme to think they are watching all 3,000 SOIs at the same time.\nWhat we know about Manchester suspect\nManchester attack: The victims\nAnd that means they must constantly prioritise and reprioritise. It is a pretty ruthless, and if they make the wrong call, potentially painful process.\nThe 7 July 2005 attack on London was earth-shattering for the security service.\nDuring the eventual inquests, it emerged that between MI5 and West Yorkshire Police there had been six potential intelligence strands in which the ringleader had come on to the radar.\nThe service pledged to massively improve its systems. There was a huge reorganisation of itself and counter-terrorism policing to create powerful regional hubs that share intelligence like never before.\nSince 2013,  18 plots have been thwarted, Whitehall officials say. That's a better strike rate than some of our continental neighbours.\nBut as the workload mounts, as it has done thanks to Syria, so do the chances that something will be missed.\nEvery piece of intelligence that comes into the system - be it from a communications intercept, a public tip-off or another source - must be tested for links to ongoing investigations.\nAnd since 2014, we have known how the security service prioritises those investigations thanks to an immensely detailed document published by the Intelligence and Security Committee.\nManchester is \"Priority 1\" in the MI5 jargon because there is \"credible and actionable\" intelligence of attack planning.\nFurther down the ladder come:\n•Those planning to fight overseas\n•Fundraisers, suspects training in the UK, and people involved in false documents\n•People of concern who need to be further checked out\n•People who were previously a threat with a risk of \"re-engagement\"\nIf security chiefs think there may be a bomb-maker on the loose - as is the case at the moment - they will be throwing everything at it.\nAnalysts, surveillance units and specialist teams - who deploy the bugs or secretly search property - are reassigned to which investigation needs them most.\nThe benefits of such a robotic and systematic way of working are plain to see.\nBut along the way, a proportion of the investigations - and therefore the time of teams - will lead nowhere other than to confirm the intelligence was worthless.\nTake this scenario: Someone calls in to say that Person X is saying scary things and buying hair bleach - a chemical that can be used to make a bomb.\nA week later, and after an awful lot of effort, it turns out that Person X is opening a beauty salon and it was a malicious call from an embittered former partner. These are the day-to-day challenges of grading intelligence.\nSince the Manchester operation began on Monday it has sucked in more and more national counter-terrorism resources. It's taken on an international dimension because of the increasingly important link to Libya.\nEach property search or seizure of a phone opens even more avenues of investigation for the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and colleagues.\nSome of those avenues will become, in time, entirely separate investigations.\nAnd each of these leads will need to be worked to a conclusion, one way or another.\nAnd that brings us round to the big question yet to be fully answered in the Manchester investigation: was there a missed opportunity to apprehend Salman Abedi?\nWe know that the killer had been known in some shape or form to the authorities. Muslim community sources have told the BBC that they called the anti-terrorism hotline about his mindset.\nAnd we know from official sources that Abedi had been one of a larger pool of \"former\" SOIs whose risk remained subject to review by MI5 and its partners.\nWherever he had started in the prioritisation system, he ended up right at the bottom of the list - someone they might need to review in the future if there was \"credible\" and \"actionable\" intelligence that he was re-engaging in terrorist-related activity.\nBut we don't know why he was downgraded - what investigators turned up and how, in the prioritisation system, he was deemed to be of insufficient interest.\nWere those calls to the anti-terrorist hotline lacking the detail of credible and actionable intelligence? Did they come before or after he was put to one side?\nOr was it just partial information? Too little to trigger a new probe when there were too many more pressing demands for attention?\nThe answer to that question is key.",

    "document": "Handing over an envelope containing 50,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) ($2.4, Â£1.6) did not do the trick, but when she added another 50,000 VND, the referral was secured.\nThe 33-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, then gave an envelope containing 500,000 VND ($24, Â£16) to the medical staff at the provincial hospital, an amount that was more than two months of her income.\n\"All other patients told me that everyone must give envelopes to thank the doctors and nurses for the treatment, and that was the rate for such an operation,\" she said.\nThe staff did not ask for it but she believed that by giving the envelope her son would receive better care.\nShe is not alone. Mrs Phin, a pensioner from a Hanoi suburb who lives on 3m VND per month, handed over an envelope containing 200,000 VND after eye treatment in hospital.\nBut she was sent home before the treatment was complete. So she was admitted to hospital again and that meant another thank-you envelope.\n\"It cost me another 200,000 VND to thank the doctors and nurses. I could only afford the smallest amount suggested by other patients,\" she said.\nMrs Luyen, a retired teacher from a small town 35km outside of Hanoi, said passing over a cash gift for medical treatment was effectively mandatory.\n\"Not all doctors ask for the envelopes but giving envelopes is a must when you go to hospital. It's in our culture,\" she said.\nIn Vietnam, medical treatment is mostly subsidised by the state via an insurance system free to civil servants and children, or paid for privately or by employers.\nBut queues for treatment under insurance cover are long and public hospitals overcrowded, while salaries for much of the medical profession remain low.\nAnd with growing capitalist sentiment meeting entrenched Confucian values, the practice of handing over a cash-filled envelope to secure faster or better service has become widespread.\nThe number of people who gave envelopes doubled in the three years from 2007-2010 - from 13% to 29%, one study showed.\nIn 2012, a survey published by the World Bank and Vietnam's Government Inspectorate (which runs the Anti-Corruption Bureau) showed that 76% of those who had paid a bribe to health service personnel did so voluntarily, with only 21% responding to a request.\nIn an effort to fight corruption, five big hospitals in Hanoi launched a campaign in October 2011 to bolster ethical behaviour among staff, including a \"Say no to envelopes\" policy.\nVietnam's Research and Training Centre for Community Development (RTCCD) also conducted a similar campaign to change perceptions of informal payments, using the media to raise patients' awareness of their rights as well as of doctors' duties.\nNguyen Huu Ngoc, a well-known scholar in Hanoi, said the root of the problem lay in the Confucian gift-giving tradition.\n\"In Vietnamese society as well as in Chinese, gifts stem from gratitude,\" the scholar said.\n\"Showing gratitude used to have more spiritual value than material value. But over the years, it has become more material and less spiritual, and now in the market economy it is like a transaction.\"\nCulture might be used to justify the payments - but culture can be changed, according to Soren Davidsen, a senior governance specialist at the World Bank in Hanoi.\n\"We know gift-giving is an important part of culture. But we also know that culture is not a static but dynamic thing. Several countries in East Asia, such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have a culture of corruption, yet these countries have found effective ways to curb corruption.\n\"Although there is often the perception about culture being a part of corruption, we think that this is the wrong way of looking at it. And we can, by involving people, businesses and government in partnership, actually change culture,\" said Mr Davidsen.\nFor many people, the line between a gift and a bribe has become blurred - something some people embrace as \"an excuse to give envelopes\", said Tran Thu Ha, vice-director of RTCCD.\nBut for people who campaign to stop the practice like her, it is easy to identify what is a gift and what is a bribe.\n\"A gift can be given in public or anywhere, it needs time to talk and to say thank you, whereas a bribe is often given very quickly and both the giver and the receiver are afraid of being seen by other people,\" Ms Ha said.\nBut to change people's behaviour is one of the big difficulties that Vietnam is facing and will take time, acknowledged Mr Ngo Manh Hung, deputy director-general of Vietnam's Anti-Corruption Bureau.\nThere has been considerable debate about how to curb the practice in the health service. One suggestion is raising health workers' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes.\nBut that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them.\nBut work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do.\nNguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry.\nBut this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task.\n\"It's not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power,\" said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank.\n\"It's a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies. It is not a quick fix and can't be done overnight.\"\nThere will be a series of special reports and articles this week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.",

We therefore fear a return to decline in the months ahead.",

    "document": "Lower down this article\nThe top players, forced to enter from the beginning of the 128-man event, will come up against some unfamiliar names in the first round before the BBC's live coverage begins with the second round on Saturday.\nFormer world champion and BBC Sport pundit Ken Doherty, who plays world number 89 Mitchell Mann on Thursday, assesses the contenders and possible stories that could emerge at the Barbican Centre.\nMost of the leading players have won a tournament so far this season.\nFour-time UK champion Ronnie O'Sullivan managed to retain his Champion of Champions crown in Coventry, while defending UK champion Neil Robertson triumphed at the Wuxi Classic in June.\nJudd Trump won the Australian Open and Mark Selby, whose wife gave birth to their first child earlier this month, claimed a European Tour event in Latvia. Ding Junhui, winner of five ranking titles last season, continued where he left off by winning the first Asian Tour event.\nThe man going into the tournament in excellent form is Shaun Murphy. The 2008 UK champion made a 147 break in last week's European Tour event in Germany. Remarkably, it was his third attempt at a maximum during the event, having previously failed on the final blue and final green.\nKen Doherty's view: You will see the usual suspects in the latter stages. Ronnie O'Sullivan has been in superb form and Shaun Murphy was outstanding in Germany, topping it off with a 147 break. Ding has had a consistent few years and it enjoyed his first major win in the UK in 2005. The public always love watching Judd Trump, he is so exciting.\nMaybe this tournament might have come too soon for Mark Selby because there is a bit of upheaval when a child is born. When my son came along in 2007, I was at the UK a couple of days later and I was floating on air and very proud to be a new father. It took a bit of focus away from my snooker that week, there is no doubt about it. I ended up going out in the first round against Nigel Bond.\nOn the evidence of O'Sullivan's performances at the Champion of Champions event, he will be the man to beat. Having compiled four centuries in the final against Judd Trump, The Rocket - usually his own harshest critic - stated afterwards, \"I think I am playing better than I ever have.\"\nAn added motivation will be the chance to surpass Stephen Hendry's record of 775 career centuries. O'Sullivan is currently on 764 and could achieve the feat in York.\nHowever, his results in the two ranking events he has entered this season were disappointing. A first-round round loss to Alan McManus in the Shanghai Masters was followed by a quarter-final defeat against Mark Williams at the International Championship.\nDoherty's view: O'Sullivan will be the favourite. The way he has been playing the last couple of years, I think he is getting better with age. He is more of a complete player than he has ever been. He hasn't slowed down on his scoring prowess because his break building is as good as ever.\nWhat you are seeing from him now is a more complete package. He doesn't spit the dummy out like he would have done a few years ago and doesn't lose his focus. He is hungrier than he has ever been. The game needs players like him. There is no doubt that he is the man to beat because he sets the barometer for all the other players.\nAli Carter competes in his biggest event since making a comeback to the sport after treatment for lung cancer. This season, the 35-year-old won the General Cup title in Hong Kong - his first event since being diagnosed in May - by beating Murphy 7-6 in the final.\nCarter, who has also overcome testicular cancer, was set to return to action at a European Tour event in Bulgaria in October but was advised to rest after pain in his left arm prevented him from practising. He faces China's Zhang Anda in the first round in York.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDoherty's view: It is a fantastic story. Ali has always been a top player and has had his hardships away from the table. He is a brave lad and fought every challenge that has been put in front of him. The cancer was his biggest challenge and it is good to see him back. He is well liked and has the heart of a lion. He will get a great reception from the crowd and that may just inspire him.\nHe had almost six months out and will have been resting after undergoing treatment. He would have got back on the table as soon as he summoned up the strength and that will have taken courage in itself. To do so well in his comeback tournament was remarkable. He will be putting in a lot of work now.\nThe revamped 128-man draw means the top 16 players have lost their protection in ranking events, having previously gone through automatically to the last-32 stage. A further change this year sees the semi-finals reduced from a best-of-17 frames to a best-of-11.\n\"I don't like the changes to the semi-finals,\" said title holder Robertson. \"I thought the best-of 17 was what kept the prestige of the UK Championship, but this is something I don't agree with at all.\n\"It is very unfortunate for the tournament but the better player will win, although as a player you prefer the longer matches, especially in the semi-final and final.\"\nDoherty's view: The format is a fair reflection and it needs to be done for a money list where all players play in the same round like in tennis and golf. No matter what system you have, the cream will always rise to the top.\nI always liked the longer sessions because you get more of a chance to settle into the match. The best-of-11 is still a good match. A lot of the public don't want to wait for two sessions in the first round, they would prefer it to get done and dusted in one session.\nThe top players like Robertson enjoy the longer sessions because there is less likely to be a shock result. But, it is not all about what the players want, it is about what the public and TV people want. They are the ones paying the players' wages, so you have to be happy with it.\nThe 128-man draw means that some amateurs and lesser lights of the pro tour get a chance to face the world's best players. Some to look out for include:\nDaniel Wells: 26-year-old from Neath, plays Ronnie O'Sullivan\nWells was the first winner of the Paul Hunter Scholarship in 2007, allowing him to practice at Sheffield's World Snooker Academy alongside the likes of Ding. Having first qualified for the main tour in 2008-09, Wells has since dropped off the tour, and lost in the last 16 of Q-School attempting to regain his place. He beat Alfie Burden in the first round of the UK last season, before losing to Joe Perry.\nJoe O'Connor: 19-year-old from Leicester, plays Neil Robertson\nO'Connor is a multiple World Masters and European junior champion at pool but has competed in qualifying for snooker's ranking events this season. He claimed the scalp of world number 35 Andrew Higginson in the Wuxi Classic with a 5-0 victory, although he was given a three-frame lead after Higginson arrived late at the venue.\nOliver Brown: 20-year-old from Derbyshire, plays Mark Selby\nBrown caused a huge upset earlier this season, demolishing world number three Ding 5-0 in the Wuxi Classic to earn a place at the final stages of the tournament. Brown \"forgot to enter\" the fourth European Tour event in Germany, the last one before the UK Championship.\nJohn Sutton: 34-year-old from Ireland, plays Ding Junhui\nThe Irishman has a full-time job as a business development manager and is currently under investigation by World Snooker over \"unusual betting\" in September's International Championship qualifying match against Scot Jamie Burnett. Sutton lost the match 6-0.\nDoherty's view: All these players are potential banana skins if you don't treat them with the same respect as the top players. A lot of players can make that mistake. These guys have the ability to beat anybody so you have to be wary. There are no easy games anymore, like a few years ago. I certainly won't be taking my opponent Mitchell Mann lightly. This is a big tournament and the last thing you want to do is go out in the first round.\nIt is a great opportunity for the younger guys with there being so many tournaments and they are getting so much more experience. They can now play on TV in the first round and that is invaluable experience for them. It will give the younger players a chance to break through much quicker.\nThe UK always throws up some great matches. It will be fascinating to see how it pans out.",

    "document": "With England's 2016 fixtures completed, captain Heather Knight is heading to Australia, and another season leading Hobart Hurricanes in the Women's Big Bash League.\nA lot has happened in the past 12 months, and it's been a bit of a crazy year to be honest! Having taken over as England captain in June, the past five months have been some of my most enjoyable and rewarding in an England shirt.\nThere's no doubt that it's been challenging along the way, but I'm really enjoying leading this team. As a group we feel like we've come a long way in the past year and a lot of credit has to go to our head coach Mark Robinson and assistant coach Ali Maiden for that.\nAlongside the England captaincy, I've also led Hobart Hurricanes, Western Storm and Berkshire in the past 12 months, so I've certainly had to manage a broad range of different people - from county players who have never played in front of a decent crowd before, to established overseas international players, and England team-mates who have won more than 100 caps.\nThat is sometimes one of the hardest things to get right as a captain - knowing what to say and when to say it, to try to get the best out of those different characters on the pitch. It's not an exact science, but I feel like I'm learning and growing as a leader all of the time.\nI know that as soon as I stop trying to do that, I'll be in trouble, so I'll always be looking at ways I can get better. That's an attitude I've always had with my cricket, so I don't see why captaincy should be any different.\nDuring the second ODI against Sri Lanka earlier this month, I had a bit of a slip when I was batting and aggravated an old hamstring tendon injury, which unfortunately forced me to sit on the sidelines for the third match.\nAlthough I'm generally dreadful at watching, and always want to be involved, the girls did a brilliant job and, in my absence, they were skippered to a comfortable win by Danielle Hazell.\nThe old hamstring injury was actually the reason I started bowling off-spin in 2014, as I was no longer able to send down my (very average) 'dibbly dobbly' seamers in the nets. So something good came out of four months on the sidelines at least!\nI was quite surprised to be told that, at the conclusion of the ICC Women's Championship last week, I had finished as the second highest wicket-taker in the competition. I think a lot of those wickets have probably come down to the bowlers at the other end, but I'm proud of a good couple of years with the ball all the same.\nI think I'll always see myself as a batter who bowls a few tweakers, but it's nice to be able to contribute to the team in another way. I'm definitely glad I decided to go down the spinner's route following my injury and with a bit of encouragement from our former spin coach Carl Crowe.\nAfter about 10 days at home, I'll be heading off to Australia for the Women's Big Bash League - along with a number of my England team-mates - and rejoining the Hobart Hurricanes.\nAfter a good season with the 'Canes last year, I'm massively excited to meet up with the team again and see what the second edition of the WBBL holds.\nAlso, as an England team, we can now start looking forward to next summer's ICC Women's World Cup. As a player I don't think there is anything more exciting than getting the chance to play in a World Cup on home soil.\nI keep saying it, but it is so true, we have the best women's cricket supporters in the world, so hopefully we will get to play in front of some passionate home fans throughout the tournament next year.\nAs a West Country girl, it's great that two of the group-stage venues - Taunton and Bristol - are in this part of the country. We are also looking forward to playing at Derby and Leicester, and with a bit of luck and some good performances, at Lord's in the final on 23 July!\nYou can read more BBC columns from Heather during the winter.",

These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming.\n\"Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,\" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\"The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet.\"\nThe group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.\nBut if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?\nThe team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.\nThe found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history.\n\"Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,\" said Dr Dasgupta.",

Yes we do.\"\nHe told the programme: \"I think we need to think about legislation, we need to think about guidance, we need to think about the roles of schools, what is the role of parents and carers, enabling children and young people to empower themselves so that they can take some responsibility for their own safety.\nYsgol y Cymer in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is one school taking a pro-active approach to try to stop its pupils becoming victims of cyberbullying.\nUnder a scheme called Cymer Ofal, pupils are able to give advice to other younger pupils on Bullying and cyber-bullying.\nOne counsellor, Lowri Mitchinson, 16, who was bullied on ask.fm, said her experience could be used to help others.\n\"Some people don't see teachers as real people who actually care for you.

It wasn't a good idea to start believing stuff like that.\"\nThe bullying ended after two months but she said anyone suffering like she did should delete their accounts on the site.\nWhen asked to respond to the points raised in the Taro 9 programme, ask.fm said in a statement: \"We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our users.\n\"We are working with the pre-eminent online child safety expert Annie Mullins OBE to review and update our safety and privacy policies.\n\"This will ensure that our abuse and inappropriate content reporting systems are among the most effective in the industry.\"\nThe site is also asking users to report any bullying, insisting that complaints will be \"dealt with immediately\".\nA recent survey of nearly 1,000 children and young people in Wales by the Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales: Funky Dragon - an umbrella organisation promoting the rights of young people - appeared to show the scale of cyberbullying.\nWe're talking about online bullying and that's a situation where a person and in some instances a group of people use emails, the internet or any kind of digital technology to bully someone.\nIt could involve teasing, upsetting or humiliating and the thing is with this sort of bullying it's there 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nThere was a time when you could say bullying ended at the school gate but that's not the case any more.\nThe other thing about online bullying is that you don't always know who's responsible because it can be done anonymously and there are examples of people setting up fake accounts and hiding their IP address or even blocking their mobile number.\nParents need to be aware of what their children are doing online, understand what they're doing and make sure their children are happy to talk to them if there's a problem with bullying.\nSome 47% said they had been bullied and 37% of those said that they had suffered from cyberbullying.\nIt also suggested it was more of a problem among girls, with 43.8% reporting it compared with 27.4% of boys.\nResponding to the call for legislation, the Welsh government said developing positive and respectful relationships would be a better approach.\n\"We have published Respecting Others, a suite of comprehensive anti-bullying guidance which includes a specific section on cyberbullying,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"The guidance gives details of schools' legal responsibilities while providing them with information they need to create effective strategies for tackling bullying.\n\"There are already a number of criminal laws that can apply in terms of harassment or threatening behaviour, including threatening and menacing communications.\n\"Rather than criminalise bullying the focus should be on developing positive and respectful relationships amongst children and young people.\"\nTaro 9 is broadcast at 21:30 BST on S4C on Tuesday with English subtitles.",

    "document": "Down an alleyway in central Kano, I find one of the many Koranic schools which have changed little in generations.\nAbout 800 boys are sitting on mats chanting verses of the Koran, which they have written out on wooden tablets with short sharpened sticks, dipped in ink.\nThey do this for hours each day. For most of these boys, this is the only education they get.\nMany come from villages far away. They board at the school where conditions are basic, to put it mildly.\nAcross northern Nigeria, it is estimated that about 11 million children get no access to mainstream education.\nBut there is a growing belief that reforms are long overdue and a broader education is essential.\n\"When I was growing up I didn't get any Western education. I only attended a Koranic schools like this one,\" says Abdurrahman Muhd, the mallam, or religious teacher, as he shows the students how to write the Arabic script.\n\"But we have to change to compete with the challenges of modern society.\"\nWhen they return from afternoon prayers, about 30 of his students are given lessons in maths, Hausa, English and social sciences.\n\"Some of my own children have finished secondary school and are going to the next level after studying the Koran alongside Western education,\" says Abdurrahman Muhd, mentioning the word \"boko\" in the local Hausa language.\nBoko Haram, meaning \"Western education is forbidden\", is the nickname of the extremist group which has killed thousands of people in recent years during a brutal campaign of violence.\nIt has attacked many schools in north-east Nigeria - including the boarding school in Chibok, from where hundreds of girls were abducted, and in Buni Yadi, where dozens of boys were killed in their dormitory.\nWho are Boko Haram?\nProfile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau\nThe group wants a strictly Islamic education and for boys only.\nBoko Haram used to be extremely active here in Kano. Security has improved in what is the largest city in the north, although a suicide bombing on 18 May was an ominous warning that the threat persists.\nThe relative peace offers a chance to make improvements to the quality of education.\n\"Those children who don't go to school only stay at home and then they go out to sell things on the streets,\" Fatima, 12, tells me as we chat outside her community-based Islamiyya school in a suburb of Kano.\n\"If they are asked to write something short and simple, they can't. But I can read and write now,\" she says, beaming proudly.\n\"I stay with my grandfather but when I go home every weekend, I teach my younger siblings how to read and write and my mother is happy about that,\" Fatima says, before heading back to her English class.\nIt is a short walk to the home of her grandfather, Al Haji Sani Jibril. He is convinced that Fatima's education is good news for the whole community.\n\"I believe sending Fatima to school is like educating our whole society, because my granddaughter will influence her peers to go to school,\" he says.\n\"During my time, we did not have this opportunity to learn. I wouldn't want my children to suffer from the experiences I had,\" he says, adding that educated people are the only ones who have a say in today's society.\nBritish taxpayers are helping fund improvements to Nigeria's long-neglected education system, including these reforms to the religious schools.\nOil-rich Nigeria is not short of cash, but by offering technical expertise the goal is to improve the quality of education for both boys and girls.\nThere is a fear that more uneducated youth could end up as recruits for groups like Boko Haram.\nThe Kano state governor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has thrown his support and financial clout behind educational reforms, including the modernisation of Koranic schools.\n\"I believe it is important to engage them to make sure that they are employable, so we can reduce the challenges we are facing today,\" says  Mr Kwankwaso.\nHis government has now introduced a law banning parents from sending their children away for religious education without offering them financial support.\n\"We are all aware that there is certainly a correlation between illiteracy, poverty and conflict,\" he says.\nI asked if he was worried about the reforms, given Boko Haram's view on Western education.\n\"What we are doing here in Kano is to say that Western education is very relevant, Islamic education is very relevant and of course they have to go side by side,\" he says.\n\"That is the only way we can really make progress in this part of the country.\"\nControversy over education is not new here. Islam came to northern Nigeria more than 1,000 years ago. But secular education is a relatively recent arrival.\nBritish forces, using mainly African troops, captured Kano in 1903. Since then, there has been a degree of resistance to \"Western education\" because of the link to colonialism and a perception that Islam was under threat.\nSo for those keen to see the old and the new integrated in the religious schools, there was initially some nervousness.\n\"From the beginning, some people thought the programme was going to be small in terms of numbers,\" says educationist Yardada Maikano.\n\"But the demand has been huge as more and more mallams are calling for basic education to be integrated in their schools. So this demand is now a challenge.\n\"I feel overwhelmed, I feel elevated and I feel happy,\" she adds.\n\"And that is why I continue with the struggle to make sure that those that have not been enrolled are given a chance to have religious and secular education at the same time.\"\nImproving education in northern Nigeria was already an immense task, even before Boko Haram started its campaign of violence.\nBut every day, people are working hard here to give all children a fighting chance of fulfilling their dreams.\nFatima already has high hopes. \"I want to be a doctor or a lawyer - that is my goal,\" she says. \"I will not get married until I achieve this goal.\"",

    "document": "What did the court say?\nUntil now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work.\nOn Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day.\nThe ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive.\nI'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected?\nPossibly, yes.\nEmployees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected.\nSimon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category.\nAs many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC.\nAnd some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds.\nI travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office\nThe ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says.\nThere may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office.\nI have to commute two hours every day to my office\nFor those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK.\nI think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours?\nThe ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account).\nThat could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up.\nIt could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum.\n\"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said.\nWe have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling.\nHere is a selection of their comments:\nThis is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester\nI am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge\nI am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon\nI currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow\nI am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford\nI'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset\nI am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley\nI'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

We believe that society has a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable.\"\nIt is not illegal to attempt suicide in Scotland, but helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution.\nThe Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales, which is almost identical to the law in Northern Ireland.\nOutside Scotland, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has to approve any assisted suicide court action in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn 2010, Keir Starmer, then the DPP, issued guidance that made it clear that family or friends who travelled with a loved one to the Swiss suicide group Dignitas would not risk prosecution.\nMs MacDonald is pressing ahead with her fresh bill after getting the necessary 18 signatures from other MSPs to bring it to parliament.\nShe is officially launching the legislation at an event in Edinburgh, along with MSPs representing all the political parties and Silvan Luley, of Dignitas.\nAssisted suicide is legal in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium as well as Switzerland.\nIn the House of Lords, the Labour peer and former UK Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, has proposed a bill on legalising assisted suicide.",

The average age of a large oak in the UK is about 200 years.\nThis ancient yew could be 2,500 years old and is close to the site where King John sealed Magna Carta at Runnymede - although some argue it was under the Ankerwycke tree's shadow.\nIt is also said to be the spot where Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn.\nThis tree in St Martin's Church, Martindale, Cumbria is believed to be at least 800 years old. The nearby church has a bell with an untranslated Nordic rune cast into it and an altar apparently made from meteorite.\nAccording to legend Joseph of Arimathea, an uncle of Jesus, thrust his staff into the ground at Wearyall Hill in Somerset where it took root as a hawthorn tree.\nIt was chopped down in the Civil War but descendants survive at Glastonbury Abbey from where a flowering spray has been sent to the Monarch each Christmas since the 17th Century.\nA recent survey revealed many of the trees in Linford Manor Park are more than 300 years old and are considered significant because of their relationship to the design of the 18th Century grounds.\nThis venerable oak is a descendent of the tree the future King Charles II hid in following his defeat at the final battle of the English Civil War in 1651 at Worcester.\nThe young Charles attempted to flee to Wales but had to seek refuge in Boscobel where he hid first in a tree and then in a priest hole.\nIn 1834, six farm labourers were sentenced to seven years in an Australian penal colony after a meeting under a large sycamore in Tolpuddle to talk about falling wages.\nThere was a public outcry and their actions laid the foundations for trade unions.

    "document": "The Department for Education (DfE) met the expense from its overall budget, says the National Audit Office report.\n\"The department was unprepared for the financial implications of rapid expansion,\" the authors say.\nThe government said it made \"no apology for spending money on a programme that is proven to drive up standards\".\nIn May 2010 there were 203 academies, which are publicly funded independent state schools directly accountable to the DfE and outside local authority control. The programme was started by the Labour government as a way to transform struggling schools.\nAfter the election the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, announced plans to allow all schools in England to convert to academy status. By September 2012 some 2,309 schools had converted, representing a growth of 1,307%, and 48% of secondary pupils were attending academies.\nAmyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office (NAO), said the increase was \"a significant achievement - however the Department for Education was not sufficiently prepared for the financial implications of such a rapid expansion, or for the challenge of overseeing and monitoring such a large number of new academies\".\nAccording to the report, the department had budgeted £7.3bn to set up and run academies in the two years from April 2010 to March 2012.\nIt says officials were expecting some extra expenditure, to cover factors such as additional insurance, but were unprepared for the numbers of academies wanting to convert. In fact the total expenditure on academies amounted to £8.3bn - £1bn over budget.\nThe £1bn includes £350m paid to local authorities for temporary continued funding of places at non-academy schools, effectively double funding places while academies were being set up.\nThe report says that to fund the expansion and remain within overall spending limits, the DfE had to find the money from other budgets, including the main schools settlement.\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"We make no apology for the fact that more schools than even we imagined have opted to convert, and no apology for spending money on a programme that is proven to drive up standards and make long-term school improvements.\n\"We want as many schools as possible to take advantage of the significant benefits academy status brings because it means more schools run by great heads and teachers, not local authority or Whitehall bureaucrats, and more children getting a first-class education.\n\"The Department for Education has made significant savings in the last two and a half years and also set aside significant contingencies which have been set against the growth in academies.\n\"Additionally, the costs of converting academies have already fallen by 53% per academy. We anticipate further changes we are making will radically reduce costs in 2013-14 and beyond.\"\nMargaret Hodge MP, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \"The decision to change fundamentally the nature of the programme away from one solely directed at struggling schools is up to the government, but taxpayers have the right to expect a more considered and controlled approach to public spending than the department has so far displayed.\"\nShadow education secretary Stephen Twigg called for greater scrutiny, oversight and local accountability \"to ensure school standards improve and the taxpayer gets value for money\".\nThe figures also drew criticism from teaching unions with Mary Bousted, of the Association and Teachers and Lecturers, saying they showed \"only too clearly that the expansion of academies is being driven by political ideology and not by what's best for children's education\".\nChristine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It is absurd for the government to justify spending £8.3bn on academy conversions in two years while at the same time warning of a dire economic situation. Meanwhile, many good state schools are told there's no money as they stand in a state of disrepair with ever-diminishing support services.\"",

How are you?\nJillian: We're great, thank you! We're in the car between photo shoots.\nIs that as glamorous as it sounds?\nJillian: Yeah, why not? It's definitely a lot of fun. Good to have the photos for later on in life!\nDo you get to take the clothes home?\nLucas: No!\nJillian: I'm working on that. Actually, the shoes I have on right now were part of a shoot. I kept talking about them and eventually they worked it out so I got to take them home with me. Hopefully down the line we'll get some more freebies!\nDoes being a dancer help you in front of the camera?\nJillian: I definitely think I'm more aware of how to hold my body. But Lucas isn't a dancer and he's doing just fine.\nLucas: She's been showing me some moves. I'm learning.\nHow long have you been Lion Babe?\nJillian: It's been two years since we've been working as Lion Babe every day - but our friendship started six years ago.\nI met Lucas at a party where, just by chance, I heard his music. So I introduced myself and told him I liked it. We didn't really stayed connected, but I followed his MySpace. And then I ended up in New York for college. I had to do a piece for school with original music - and Lucas was the only producer I knew.\nWe did that and it went very well. A very easy collaboration. Eventually I mentioned I was interested in singing and he came over to my apartment. He was making beats up right on the spot and our first attempt at making a real song was actually Treat Me Like Fire, which was our first single.\nThat song got you a lot of attention. When did you realise it had taken on a life of its own?\nJillian: When we first got a response from the UK, that was definitely surprising.  It was maybe two weeks after the song came out, and we were like: \"Woah! How did people in the UK find this?\"\nThen we started getting emails from UK labels. It all happened very fast but we knew the door was open, so we wanted to take it seriously.\nGrowing up in a showbusiness family (Hervey's mother is actress and singer Vanessa Williams), was it always in the back of your mind that you'd pursue music?\nJillian: Actually, growing up, I didn't want to go into acting and singing because that was my mum's thing. It was too much pressure. But dancing gave me more confidence to try other things.\nTreat Me Life Fire sampled Eunice Collins, and your next single sampled Nina Simone. It's very brave to draw that comparison. I guess you're very confident in your voice?\nJillian: I wouldn't say that! That's the beauty of working with a great producer. If he had the guts to make the beat I had to have the guts to sing it.\nI knew I didn't want to sound like all these people on the radio, so having these unique, rich voices was a challenge. If Nina Simone's on the track, I'd better step my game up!\nYou practically disappeared for 18 months after Treat Me Like Fire. What was happening?\nLucas: We had to write more songs! A lot of people thought we were more established that we actually were. In the end we only had one song.\nWhat's it like working with Pharrell and Mark Ronson? Is there a danger they'll dilute what made you special in the first place?\nLucas: We're not really worried about watering anything down. In the end, the main thing is \"do we feel it or not?\" If we don't, we should just move on.\nBut as fans of music, the experience of working with these people is amazing. I learned so much in our session. Not so much from the things he said but from watching him work. All of that cycles in your head for the next week. It expands your mind.\nSo what's Pharrell like in the studio?\nLucas: We had two days with him in Miami. He's a really busy guy, so he was working on other things at the same time.\nWe'd go into the studio and get started. Then he'd come in and vibe out for a minute, and he'd make some parts right there and then - like a bass line or a little guitar riff. Then he'd be like, \"OK, I gotta go. I'll be back in a couple of hours\".\nSo we'd take the parts and start writing and re-arranging. Then he'd come back and we'd show him what we'd got. He'd be like, 'OK that's cool\" and maybe lay down another line on top.\nSince you've been in the UK, you've performed covers of Curtis Mayfield's Move On Up and Janis Joplin's Piece of my Heart. Is that the kind of music you're trying to emulate?\nJillian: Not necessarily. When it came to doing these sessions, we really wanted to think of an American artist who'd come over the UK with a raw funky flavour, and who was really embraced. So if it wasn't a Janis song, it would have been Jimi Hendrix.\nOur parents introduced us to funk and soul, so it's a natural place for us to go - but we also love The Strokes and Grace Jones and Lee Scratch Perry.\nOften the songs we reference when we're writing are completely different from the ones we end up making!\nWhat are you obsessing over at the moment?\nLucas: This guy called D.R.A.M. - he's got this song called Cha Cha, which has this great melody with this mariachi, almost cheesy, trumpet sound. It's so good.\nTrumpets seem to be back in fashion at the minute.\nJillian: I like it. I used to play trumpet so why not? My trumpet's actually red. Fun fact.\nIs that coming out on the tour?\nJillian: Not telling!\nWonder Woman is out now on Outsiders/Universal. Lion Babe's debut album follows later this year.",

Roberts, though, insists that the players are not giving too much thought to the record.\n\"The team spirit's been great since day one, when the manager came in and the boys came back for pre-season,\" he said.\n\"We've kept each other going, we've had good times, fun together, and done well on the pitch. It shows in results and if we continue to do that, it should be a very good season for us.\n\"It's [about] momentum, you feel good, positive and go into every game believing you can win. The more you win, the more positive you are. We're in good stead right now and we'll go into Wednesday firing and ready to go.\n\"We're just going out with the mentality to win every game. On Wednesday we'll show that again. We'll be buzzing to be back in the league and looking to put on a good show.\n\"It's more other people [looking at the record], we just focus on trying to win.

It was the brainchild of his son Ji Lee, a 45-year-old creative director at Facebook, which owns Instagram.\nThe family emigrated to Sao Paulo from Seoul in 1981.\nBut Ji Lee and his wife eventually relocated to New York while his sister and her husband made the decision to return to Korea with their two sons, who were the centre of Chan Jae's world.\n\"My father was retired and spending time with my nephews, like driving them to school, was a huge part of his day. After they left, he had nothing to do and that scared my mother and me,\" said Mr Lee.\n\"We were very worried that he would age quickly without having anything to do and would become depressed.\"\nIt took him months to convince his \"quiet reserved\" father who \"hated learning new things\" that he should draw for his grandchildren, as he had for his children, and post the pictures online to stay in touch.\n\"He hated the idea and just could not grasp the concept. He didn't understand the purpose of why we wanted to share his art on Instagram but I was determined to teach him,\" he told BBC News from his home in New York.\n\"But I sat down with him every day and at dinner one night, we had a conversation about drawing for my son. That was the turning point and eventually he became more receptive to learn.\"\n\"Capturing his style of drawing\" was another big struggle he faced.\n\"Now he uses different editing tools and can even understands hashtags so that was revolutionary.\"\n\"This Instagram account really changed my father's life. Since then, he's been making one drawing a day. My mother writes the stories and my father brings them to life.\"\nDinosaurs, pandas, superheroes and nature are all common themes in Chan Jae's work for his grandchildren.\nThe daily life and culture of Korea also feature prominently.\nMore importantly, each post teaches a lesson, shares a memory or even carries a personal message. They are translated into three languages: English, Korean and Portuguese.\n\"Your grandma is a super woman. She's carrying a baby in front and another on her back. Children, please don't forget,\" read one heart-warming post.\nTo take things a step further, Ji Lee told his father's story through a video on Facebook which went viral, gathering more than 18,000 reactions and 1.3m views on the site.\nHe said he was shocked by how popular his video had become.\n\"I went to bed and when I woke up, it had gone viral. The Instagram account has also grown and he now has more than 40,000 followers.\"\nThousands of users on Facebook wrote about how Chan Jae's story touched them.\n\"This is amazing on so many levels. A modern living legacy. Your brilliance has so much depth,\" said Valerie LaMastro.\nOthers like David Harvey shared similar experiences with getting elderly people to make use of technology.\n\"That's a wonderful story. Beautiful drawings and a beautiful job telling the story, too. My father also had little to no interest in technology until texting and now it has brought us much closer together.\"\nDevrin Carlson-Smith said: \"I was one of the first to follow 'Drawings for my Grandchildren' and told you the story of how I got my mum into Instagram. I love that your dad is back into his art. I hope to do that too so I don't lose my skills.\"\nTo Ji Lee, the most rewarding part of this all was helping others around the world.\n\"So many people are sharing my video and interacting with it.

I have funded this equipment myself, however one of the receivers for my hearing aid is loaned by the university.\n\"My course was not eligible for DSA funding which is why the university has struggled to supply me with the full support I need, such as an electronic note-taker.\n\"I will be applying for DSA for my degree in 2016. I am very concerned that I will not get the support that I need to achieve my full potential and I know that hundreds of other disabled students are also worried.\n\"The government says it is unlikely to impact existing arrangements with students, but what about if you decided to do further study at a different university?\n\"I aim to specialise my fashion design degree with a masters in knitwear, I have concerns this further study may not be possible for me due to lack of  support.\n\"Disabled students should be allowed equal opportunities to non-disabled students and to put it bluntly, the cuts to DSA limit our futures.\n\"Having discussed the cuts to DSA with deaf and other disabled students I have seen a trend in a loss of hope. These students, myself included, feel disregarded by the government  and our access to higher  education has been unjustly restricted.\"\nIn the statement, Mr Johnson said a review of the 25-year-old scheme had long been overdue.\nHe wants universities to fulfil their legal duties to disabled students under the 2010 Equality Act.\n\"Higher education providers should discharge their duties under the Equality Act to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate disabled students, as other organisations and businesses do.\"\n\"More inclusive learning environments\" and better use of technology were essential, he said.\nThe allowances will still be the primary source of funding for certain types of support, for example for guides for blind or partially sighted students, but much other support must be funded by universities.\nUniversities will be expected to meet more of the costs of specialist accommodation and of printing and scanning, while computer accessories will be funded \"by exception only\".\nSusan Daniels said the allowances were \"a lifeline\".\n\"We know deaf students can achieve just as much as their hearing peers, but the right support must be in place.\n\"Deaf students desperately need support such as note-takers because they cannot lip-read a lecturer or follow a sign language interpreter and take notes at the same time.\n\"Deaf young people are telling us they feel the government is intent on making it more difficult for them to go to university. We strongly believe the government must think again or guarantee safeguards will be in place to protect deaf students.\"\nThe National Union of Students fears small, specialised institutions will struggle to meet the costs.\nDisabled students' officer Maddy Kirkman said the changes risked inconsistency in support and complained the government had ignored these concerns.\n\"To make higher education accessible, the government needs to work with students and institutions and take our views into account, not brush them aside.\"\nThe Green party said the changes amounted to a £70m cut to support for disabled students.\nSpokeswoman Mags Lewis suggested the changes would mean cuts to computer support, proof-reading and scribing, with older students with weak computer skills, particularly badly affected.\nShe warned that disabled students could \"fall into a no man's land\" with government and universities each claiming it is the other's responsibility.\nThe document says a new quality assurance framework will be put in place to ensure students get the help they need and best value for money.\n\"I am determined to ensure disabled students should be able to make use of and develop their talents through higher education and that there should be no cap on their aspirations,\" wrote Mr Johnson.\nA Universities UK spokesman pointed out institutions have a legal duty to support disabled students, \"which they will all do like any other organisation.\n\"The important thing also will be to reassure all students that support for disabled students will continue to be available.\"",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nWith darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters.\nTwo Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality.\nDanny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit.\nIn a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National.\nWillett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course.\nThe 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee...\nDanny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan.\nJonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: \"We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters.\" We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in.\nDanny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par.\nDanny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead.\nThe tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said, 'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner.\nJonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week.\nDanny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10.\nDanny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11.\nJonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us.\nWillett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5\nDanny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us.\nJonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous.\nDanny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said 'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nJonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard.\nDanny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one.\nJonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting.\nDanny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying 'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking 'this is what you practise for'.\nI kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead.\nJonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nDanny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet.\nJonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny 'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused.\nDanny: We rolled in our birdie putt.\nJonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt.\nDanny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers.\nJonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row.\nDanny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip.\nJonny: I was thinking 'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought 'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought 'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot!\nDanny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is.\nDanny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood.\nJonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green.\nDanny: He said: 'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.'\nJonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand.\nDanny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees.\nJonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger.\nDanny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable.\nJonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him: 'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.'\nDanny: I'd done 80% of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before.\nJonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying 'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more.\nDanny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par.\nJonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters.\nDanny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting.\nJonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off.\nDanny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does.\nSpieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play.\nDanny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie.\nJonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him.\nDanny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true.\nDanny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now.\nJonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it.\nDanny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.",

    "document": "The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at \"breaking point\".\nA third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April.\nCouncils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding \"gap\" exacerbated by the cost of social care.\nBut the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010.\nAlthough councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care.\nMinisters say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the \"precept\" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years.\nYears of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year.\nSurrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote.\nLabour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies.\nPublishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had \"thought better\" of it in recent weeks.\nInflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year.\nThe LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future.\nOf the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be \"noticed\" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services.\nA number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% \"social care precept\" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit.\nJonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: \"Local government finances are at breaking point.\"\n\"We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system.\n\"Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020.\"\nHe said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands \"off the government's agenda\".\n\"None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work.\n\"Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change.\"\nA spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: \"Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum.\n\"Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value.\n\"We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years.\"",

He also claims that digital downloads were undercounted.\nIn a statement, Carpenter said he had been unable to resolve the dispute without suing.\n\"The Carpenters recordings are among the best sellers in the history of popular music, and after 48 years continue to contribute a substantial amount to [Universal's] annual bottom line,\" he wrote. \"It seems only fair that these companies account fairly to my sister's estate and to me.\"\nSpecialising in radio-friendly soft rock, The Carpenters sold millions of records in the 1970s. The brother-sister duo won three Grammy Awards in 1970 and 1971, including best new artist and best vocal performance for the ballad (They Long to Be) Close to You.\nThe band's career was cut short when Karen developed anorexia nervosa in 1975. Although they continued to record, the condition eventually led to her death, from heart failure.\nRichard Carpenter's legal claim is one of many filed in the US after a 2010 court case involving Eminem, which resulted in a ruling that artists should receive higher royalty payments for digital downloads than they do when a CD or vinyl album is sold.\nThe difference is substantial. According to Billboard, artists get 15% of the money generated by the sale of a record. For downloads, which are counted as \"licensed content\",  the figure 50%.\nArtists including Peter Frampton, Public Enemy, Whitesnake and The Temptations have all sued, or threatened to sue, in order to obtain the higher rate.\nUniversal Music were not immediately available to respond to the latest case.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

    "document": "But analysts say high European gas stocks will limit the turbulence.\nGas futures climbed by up to 10% in early trading, while the benchmark price for oil rose by more than 2%.\nTraders are worried about the stability of supplies from Russia, which provides a quarter of Europe's natural gas, half of it through Ukraine.\nHowever, a relatively mild winter has reduced demand for heating fuel, with storage levels at the main gas hubs about 20% greater than last year.\nIn Germany, Europe's biggest gas consumer and Russia's largest customer, stocks are at more than 60% of capacity, capable of satisfying 60 days of demand.\nRussia is Europe's biggest supplier of natural gas, but the continent has been weaning itself off dependence on its neighbour for the last decade.\nIt now imports less than 30% of its natural gas from Russia, compared with 45% in 2003, according to European Union statistics.\nEurope is also less reliant on the Ukraine link, with improved gas infrastructure now meaning supplies could go via alternative routes in the event of disruption.\nThe Nord Stream pipeline, which goes through the Baltic Sea to Germany, or another route to Germany via Belarus and Poland, are two options.\nRussian state gas producer, Gazprom, also plans to build another sub-sea pipeline - the South Stream - to bypass Ukraine by 2016.\n\"Low utilisation means Ukraine's gas network is of lesser importance today than in the past,\" said US market analysts, Bernstein Research, in a note to clients.\nThere are also doubts that Russia could afford to disrupt or cut part of its gas supply to Europe, which is worth almost $100m (£60m) a day. Analysts estimate it accounts for about 3% of Russian economic output.\nRussia's economy registered disappointing growth of 1.3% last year, and its central bank has lowered its own forecasts, anticipating growth of below 2% until at least 2016.\nGazprom said on Monday that supplies to Europe via Ukraine were unaffected, but a previous Russian supply cut to Ukraine caused major disruption across the continent and pushed up prices significantly.\nIn January 2009 Russia turned off the taps to its neighbour in a row over contract prices and accusations that Ukraine had been siphoning off gas meant for European customers.\nThe two-week shutdown, during a very cold spell, resulted in severe disruptions across the continent, with more than a dozen countries without their expected supplies of Russian gas.\nBy Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent\nEnergy is at the heart of the commercial links between Russia and the European Union.\nRussia is the EU's biggest outside supplier of oil, and of coal and gas, which are important fuels for electricity as well as heating.\nCurtailing that trade is unappealing to both sides. Russia needs the income from its largest export market, and Europe needs the energy - though the timing makes it less vulnerable than it might be. A relatively mild winter is coming to an end, and Europe has healthy gas stocks.\nBut energy is a battleground where neither the EU nor Russia wants to fight.\nSpecial report: Energy\nBulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia, who were almost completely dependent on supplies via Ukraine, were left with major shortages.\nParts of Europe had to shut down industrial plants and domestic heating systems, find alternative sources of gas or switch energy plants to oil. Slovakia and Bulgaria considered restarting mothballed nuclear reactors.\nWhile traders say healthy European gas stocks would limit the impact of another shutdown, any disruption in the current crisis would almost certainly lead to a sharp rise in gas prices.\n\"Shifts in the global energy market have left Russia with less of a grip, but this nonetheless remains important,\" said Michala Marcussen, an economist at Societe Generale, in a research note.\nGazprom has already warned Ukraine that it may increase the gas price for Kiev after the first quarter.\n\"The situation with payments is worrying,\" said Andrei Kruglov, Gazprom's chief financial officer.\n\"Ukraine is paying but not as well as we would like it to. We are still thinking about whether to extend the pricing contract into the next quarter based on current prices.\"\nConcerns about one of Europe's key gas supply routes have had a knock-on effect on other commodities, especially oil, as demand for alternative fuels increased.\nThe benchmark oil price, Brent Crude, rose to a peak of $112.10 per barrel in early trading, its highest since 30 December.\nIts rise is also due to concerns about oil supplies from Russia, one of the world's largest oil producers, as well as the impact of any disruption in the gas market.\n\"Oil markets are reacting on the potential that the situation could worsen,\" said Ben Le Brun, a market analyst at OptionsXpress.\n\"I definitely suspect oil will move much higher, if it actually comes to war.\"\nMeanwhile, on the gas markets, UK prices for next-month delivery climbed as much as 10%, with German and Dutch prices rising by a similar amount, according to ICE Futures Europe exchange.\nThe unrest in Ukraine also sent the Russian rouble to a record low against the US dollar, prompting Russia's central bank to raise its key lending rate by 1.5%.\nAs a result, the main index of Russian stocks, MICEX, dropped by 11%, with Gazprom shares slumping by 13%.",

All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us.\n\"There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep.\"\nIn the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England.\n\"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest\".\n\"It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps. In his eyes, there was only defeat. He had lost an army.\"\nThe German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation.\nMy father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a \"lack of moral fibre\".\n\"We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others.\n\"Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital.\n\"About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches.\"\nThe captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain.\n\"We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return.\"\nTo my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo.\n\"This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day,\" he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.",

In a statement, it told the BBC: \"We are not in a position to stop clubs from buying players, but the clubs will face sanctions if they fail to abide by Financial Fair Play rules.\"\nUefa introduced break-even FFP rules in 2013 to stop clubs accumulating too much debt and to prevent wealthy owners from injecting too much cash into their clubs.\nThe rules state that over a three-year period a club like PSG, which is owned by the Gulf state of Qatar via its Oryx Qatar Sports Investments fund, can spend 30m euros more than it earns.\nIt is possible that PSG has accumulated lots of profits over the past two years to make it easier for them to make such a big outlay in the current year.\nUefa allows spending on things like stadiums, youth development and women's teams to be excluded from the calculations.\nBarcelona was given the whole transfer fee up front, but that does not mean it has to all be accounted for in the current year.\n\"For FFP accounting purposes, the transfer fee will be divided over the length of the player's contract,\" says Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at Sheridans.\n\"So if it's a five-year deal, that will count as around £40m of transfer spending per year.\"\nBut £40m a year plus wages is still a hefty outlay, so how might PSG balance the books?\nThere has been much talk of the club recouping the outlay by selling lots of Neymar shirts, but Mr Geey is not optimistic.\n\"It's a complete misnomer that clubs make a fortune from shirt sales increasing after big transfers,\" he says.\nKit deals tend to involve a big outlay up front with only limited profit-sharing of 10% to 15% after a certain number of shirts have been sold, he explains, so many millions of extra shirts would have to be sold to make serious inroads into the extra spending.\nOf course, it may mean the club receives more money from Nike when it comes to renegotiate, but its current deal runs until 2022.\nPSG is presumably confident that such a high-profile player will help it to sign other commercial deals and there is no limit to the number of official products they could have.\nWe do not know what deal has been struck over Neymar's image rights, but if PSG can get a proportion of those it will help with meeting the FFP rules.\nThen there is money to be earned on the pitch. PSG is already making a considerable amount of money in the Champions League - in the last five years it has reached the quarter-finals four times and been knocked out in the round of 16 once.\nLast year, a team getting to the semi-final was paid an extra 7.5m euros (£6.7m), the losing finalists earned 11m euros (£9.9m) and the winner 15.5m euros (£14m). And that's just prize money, there are other pots of cash distributed to successful teams.\nThe club came second in the French league last year but had won the title for the previous four years so there is not much scope for extra prize money there.\nThey may argue that their huge acquisition will make French football more popular and lead to more lucrative television deals from around the world, but that would be a big impact for a single player, although it might help them sell expensive hospitality packages at their stadium the Parc des Princes.\nOf course, PSG could always balance the books by selling a few of their existing players, but losing them would not help their Champions' League ambitions.\nPSG fell foul of the FFP rules in 2014 when Uefa ruled that a £167m commercial contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority was unfairly generous - effectively, the governing body ruled that Qatar had been using the contract to bypass the FFP rules.\nThey were given a £20m fine, their spending was capped at £49m and they competed in the 2014-15 Champions League with 21 players in their squad instead of the usual 25.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter",

    "document": "Credit rating agencies, in essence, rate a country on the strength of its economy.\nMore specifically, they score governments (or large companies) on how likely they are to pay back their debt.\nA rating affects how much it costs governments to borrow money in the international financial markets. In theory, a high credit rating means a lower interest rate (and vice versa).\nThis is because of concerns at the impact that leaving the European Union may have on the UK economy. Moody's warned that the referendum result may have \"negative implications for the country's medium-term growth outlook\".\nIn addition to Moody's, the other two main credit rating agencies are Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.\nAll three are private companies, not government agencies. Moody's and Standard & Poor's both have their headquarters in New York, while Fitch has two official HQs, one in New York and the other in London.\nEach agency gives countries around the world a specific credit rating score. These range from a top mark of \"AAA\", which stands for \"prime\", down to the lowest reading of \"D\", which stands for \"in default\".\nIn between there are scores such as \"BBB\" or \"CC\". Moody's has at total of 21 ratings.\nThe agencies also give outlook-assessments. These are either \"positive\", \"stable\", or \"negative\". They indicate whether the agency in question thinks it may soon raise its rating (positive), downgrade it (negative), or leave it the same (stable) for the country in question.\nIn the case of Moody's and the UK, the agency currently scores the UK at \"Aa1\", the second highest rating on its scale, which stands for \"high grade\".\nYet, while Moody's previously saw no change to that Aa1 rating, it has now warned that it may lower it.\nA country's credit rating can affect how much it costs a governments to borrow money on the global markets.\nMore specifically, the worse a nation's credit rating, the more likely it is that the country in question has to offer a higher rate of return on its bonds in other to persuade people and financial institutions to buy them.\nThis is because the lower a country's credit rating, the more the agencies are concerned about its economy, and in turn the taxes that the government in question can raise. Ratings can be a warning system for potential investors, and make it more expensive for poorly-rated nations to borrow money.\nAlthough Moody's is the first of the big three ratings agencies to make an official change to its position on the UK post-referendum, the Financial Times reported on Friday that Standard & Poor's considers its current top rating for the UK as \"no longer tenable\".\nCurrently S&P rates the UK as AAA (negative), while Fitch Ratings' score is AA+ (stable). For Fitch, AA+ is its second-highest score.\nThey have committees of experts who determine the actually rating for each country or large company. S&P says its committees typically consist of between five and eight people.\nThey base their assessment on a range of financial and business factors that may influence a government or company's ability to repay its debt, such as the UK voting to leave the European Union, or a business announcing a huge loss.\nStandard & Poor's is the oldest. It traces its history back to 1860 when financial analyst Henry Poor wrote a history of the finances of railroads and canals in the US as a guide for investors.\nHe then formed a business called HV and HW Poor.\nMeanwhile, the Standard Statistics Bureau was set up in 1906 to examine the finances of non-railroad companies.\nThe two businesses joined forces in 1940 when S&P was formed.\nMoody's was started in 1909 by John Moody, who published an analysis of the tangled and uncertain world of railway finances, grading the value of its stocks and bonds.\nFitch, with another eponymous founder, John Fitch, was set up in 1913.\nThere are hosts of other ratings agencies, but S&P, Moody's and Fitch have about 95% of the global market.\nS&P and Moody's have about 40% each, while Fitch has around 15%.\nThey are so dominant because they were the first to be officially endorsed by the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nIn 1975, the SEC acknowledged the three as \"Nationally Recognised Statistical Organisations\".\nSo a rating from any of the three is considered to be the gold standard.\nThey charge companies for their ratings - it's as simple as that.\nThis has led to critics suggesting that the agencies are tempted to give firms over-generous scores in order to win repeat business, something they all strenuously deny.\nThey were indeed, for giving top AAA ratings to debt packages that turned out to include billions of dollars of bad US mortgages.\nWhen the US homeowners in question started to default on their repayments it sparked the financial crisis.\nThe credit rating agencies were heavily criticised by politicians, and had to settle a number of lawsuits.",

It also promised improved accrual rates.\nMinisters fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill.\nMinisters argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but they insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector.\nUnions say their members are being asked to work longer, contribute more and receive less.",

We just focus on our work here and see how that one evolves.\n\"Pat at the moment is playing for Man City, he's featured for them, so I can't comment too much on it.\"\nDavies also confirmed there were no plans to bring in an extra central defender despite injuries to Dedryck Boyata and Erik Sviatchenko ahead of facing Astana of Kazakhstan over two legs on 16 and 22 August for a place in the Champions League group stage.\nBefore then, Celtic face Kilmarnock in the League Cup on Tuesday then travel to take on Partick Thistle in the Premiership.\n\"We've used Nir Bitton, who has played there before and done exceptionally well,\" said Davies. \"Kristoffer Ajer has filled in and Mikael Lustig can fill in as well - and we've got Jozo Simunovic.\n\"We're happy with what we've got going into tomorrow night. Astana is coming up, but we're comfortable.\n\"We're not in a desperate situation, we're comfortable and we've got six games coming up in the next 20 days, so we've got a squad we're going to have to use and everybody has to be ready.\"\nEnglishman Davies also confirmed that Celtic are talking to former winger Shaun Maloney over a coaching role at the club.\nThe 34-year-old began his career at Celtic Park, making more than 150 appearances for the Scottish champions, and the player is expected to retire after his proposed summer move to Aberdeen after leaving Hull City fell through because of persistent injuries.\n\"I can't give you anything definitive - it's something the club are looking at,\" Davies said. \"I've met him once or twice and been really impressed with him as a character and his thoughts on the game.\n\"He brings a lot of experience as a player and his Celtic connections as well.\n\"I think he would fit in really well if it were to happen. Any player that's been involved at a club as a player, especially if they've come through the academy, it gives them a good empathy for the players in that academy.\"",

    "document": "Lee, who died last year, is revered by Singaporeans, while his children are respected members of the establishment. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister.\nThe family had presented a united front, but that cracked in recent days when Lee Wei Ling, a prominent doctor and newspaper columnist, publicly objected to what she saw as excess in the one-year commemorations.\nShe also accused the government - led by her brother - of exploiting his legacy for its own gain, which Prime Minister Lee has rebutted.\nThe exchange has shocked Singaporeans - public disputes among the establishment in this tightly controlled city are extremely rare, let alone one involving the country's equivalent of the royal family or the Kennedys.\nIt has also fed into ongoing discussions on the tricky issue of how best to remember Lee Kuan Yew, a beloved idol who hated being one.\nLee's death on 23 March last year prompted a massive outpouring of grief among Singaporeans who queued for hours to pay their respects, surprising even government officials.\nAt least 100 events were organised for the one-year anniversary, ranging from solemn ceremonies and a candlelight vigil to tree-planting and kayaking events.\nWax statues of Lee - widely known as LKY - and his wife were put on public display with flowers laid at their feet, a schoolbook teaching Lee's values was launched, while some ardent fans online even claimed to have seen his face in the clouds.\nTwo days after the anniversary, amid unease in some quarters about the commemoration's intensity, Ms Lee posted a disapproving piece on Facebook arguing that her father would have objected.\n\"Any veneration could have the opposite effect and lead future generations of Singaporeans to think that my father's actions were motivated by his desire for fame, or creation of a dynasty. He strove hard and determinedly in life to advance Singapore, and not for his place in history, or leaving a great legacy,\" she wrote.\nShe later accused the government of wanting to \"glorify my father\", and alleged that a newspaper was doing the government's bidding by refusing to publish the piece unedited. The paper, The Straits Times, strongly denied her claims of censorship.\nIn a now-deleted post of an exchange with the paper's editors, she wrote that her brother \"has no qualms abusing his power to have a commemoration just one year after LKY died... if the power that be wants to establish a dynasty, LKY's daughter will not allow LKY's name to be sullied by a dishonourable son.\"\nOne Sunday, the prime minister  released a statement saying her accusations were \"completely untrue\", adding that his government felt the level of commemoration and activities \"were generally appropriate\".\nIn Singapore, Lee's admirers face the dilemma of how to honour a famously unsentimental figure who sternly disapproved of any worship - he refused statues and monuments in his name, and wanted his home to be eventually knocked down to prevent it from becoming a shrine.\nIn a 1984 interview, Lee had made clear his objections to the idea of a personality cult in Singapore, saying: \"The danger... is that when the leader dies, you are faced with the difficult problem of finding another.\"\nThe Lee siblings' squabble has divided public opinions, with many taking to their Facebook pages to weigh in.\nSome agreed that the tributes bordered on the excessive and were disrespectful.\n\"If he doesn't want to be hero worshipped then we shouldn't no matter what Singaporeans want. LKY has already given a lot to us. Let him rest in peace,\" said commenter Mohammad Nizam Abdul Kadir.\n\"The best way we can remember him is to continue as a united, multi-racial, progressive country. Uphold his values and principles,\" said another called Mano Sabnani.\nBut others argued that the round of commemoration activities was necessary for citizens, many of whom still feel a personal connection to Lee.\n\"I am one of the many who wanted to express my gratitude to him and also to remember him for his commitment and contributions to Singapore. I would humbly ask Ms Lee Wei Ling to at least indulge us as we miss him too,\" said Daniel Ng.\nCarol Sim said: \"Ms Lee has failed to understand that LKY does not belong to her alone. He belongs to the people of Singapore.\nWe respect your choice to remember your father in your own quiet way but you certainly cannot stop the people from wanting to do more.\"",

    "document": "According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men.\nGiven such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\".\n\"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\".\nBased at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered.\n\"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\"\nBut if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage?\nThat - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer.\nThe results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer.\n\"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\".\nIf that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery.\nSitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive.\nAs with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum.\n\"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient\".",

    "document": "The watchdogs, which have been going for 40 years, want higher profiles as bodies which can raise concerns about the NHS when things go wrong.\nThey admit public awareness is \"poor\" and a \"real weakness\".\nIt is set against a background of controversy about hospital reorganisations, A&E waiting times, ambulance response times.\nWe asked Peter Meredith-Smith, director of the Wales board of Community Health Councils,(CHCs) about the challenges facing the network of eight watchdogs across Wales.\nHe is a former nurse and an ex-official with the Royal College of Nursing and has also been a senior official involved in nursing and mental health with the Welsh government.\nIs the biggest problem facing CHCs that patients do not know who you are and how to make a complaint?\nThe public that engage with the CHCs very much value the role that we play in overseeing their NHS and are appreciative of the support they receive when they need help in raising concerns.\nHowever, it is disappointing that we have been described as \"the best kept secret in Wales\".  One of our highest priorities going forward is to increase public awareness of CHCs.\nAs the statutory NHS Wales watchdog we represent public and patient interests in healthcare, so it is important that they know we exist and how we can help them.\nLack of public awareness of the CHCs' independent advocacy service was a finding within Keith Evans's review of NHS complaints handling last year; we are addressing that now.\nIs this about persuading the public that CHCs are independent bodies which work in their interest, rather than in the interest of health boards or the government - has this been a problem in the past?\nAs statutory, independent bodies representing the interests of the public and patient in health, the CHCs always put the interests of the public we serve at the heart of our work.\nOur regulations, which have just been reviewed, underpin our role and our independence from the NHS that we scrutinise. Notwithstanding this, it is essential that we enjoy a trusting and constructive relationship with the NHS organisations across Wales that we oversee.\nWe work closely with them to ensure services are safe and represent the patient interest in any service changes proposed.\nWhat three issues have you as a group been seeing over the past 12-18 months which keep coming up?\nThe first is probably the major concern relating to the pressures on accident and emergency departments across Wales and the UK as a whole. This is a serious systemic issue, resulting in ambulances being unable to discharge patients in a timely way.\nThe second, relating to this, is the generally high level of delayed transfers of care, where hospital beds are needlessly occupied because of problems discharging them to community-based care.\nThe third relates to the delays in actually realising \"integrated healthcare\". There are some good examples of best practice, but the bridge between health and social care is still a very narrow one.\nIf I had a concern about the care of a relative in a nursing home - or even in his or her own home - how would you like to see it work in future?\nThe CHCs have a right to inspect the NHS care received by a resident in any care home setting.\nAs part of our programme of collaboration with other inspectorates, we are currently working closely with the Older People's Commissioner in Wales and will also be approaching Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales, (CCSIW) to see how we can deliver more comprehensive healthcare scrutiny for residents in nursing home environments.\nNHS care is just one aspect of this; we need to ensure that the care home environment as a whole preserves the dignity and overall well-being of the resident.\nYou are looking to work more closely with bodies like Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Older People's Commissioner. Is how the NHS is monitored too bureaucratic?\nWe have learned much from the Francis Inquiry into the Mid Staffs Foundation Trust, which said that when public bodies responsible for protecting the interests of patients fail to collaborate \"the consequences can be disastrous\".\nIt is quite clear that CHCs must work closely with bodies such as HIW, CSSIW and the Older Peoples' Commissioner.\nCHCs represent the public and patient - it is vital that intelligence derived from this vital source is aggregated and fused with intelligence from other sources.\nGiven the size and increasing complexity of the NHS, as well as the changing demographic healthcare needs, we must pool intelligence in order to identify the crisis points quickly and do something about them.\nWhat can you practically do about an issue like ambulance waiting times, for instance?\nThe issue of pressures on ambulance service across Wales is a very serious one. It features high on the list of issues of concern raised with us by the public.\nIt is also regularly at the top of agenda during our regular engagement meetings with health board directors.\nThis issue is symptomatic of systemic problems with the health and social services in Wales. We are working hard locally and nationally to ensure that health service planners and providers improve things.\nWe are working with the Welsh Ambulance Service on very practical day-to-day issues and are part of the Welsh government project that is looking at developing whole systems solutions to very real challenges relating to unscheduled care that we are experiencing in Wales.\nPatients have been very vocal about protecting local hospital services, especially in more rural areas. Are they really being listened to?\nA vital CHC function is public-patient engagement. It is a two-way process; we listen to the public and convey those concerns to the NHS service provider.\nIn turn, we must understand why services need to change and pass that understanding to patients.\nAccessing services in rural areas is a key area, where distance and transport issues can be exceptionally worrying. For example, maternity services, stroke services and care of the frail and elderly, where time is of the essence.\nWe work hard to ensure that these concerns are included in LHB [local health board] planning processes. Safety is key - 'safe services as locally as possible', as opposed to, 'local services as safely as possible' is a major factor.\nAll too often the public feel that they have not been listened too, eroding the trust and confidence they have in the LHB.\nCan you strike a balance though - do you also need to make the case for change, which is advocated by professional bodies like the royal colleges, for example?\nWhat clinicians say regarding the safety and effectiveness of services is vital and we always give careful consideration to what they have to say. The CHCs are responsible for representing the crucial \"lay interest\" in health service issues and what \"real effect\" the changes have on local populations.\nIt is becoming more and more the case that certain healthcare services are centralised in fewer centres of excellence, often meaning that the patient has to travel further to access it, but the care and outcome is considerably improved.\nWe work hard to ensure that any decisions made properly factor in the public and patient opinion, and that LHBs, in particular, pay this due regard and allow time to factor this in.\nCan you identify weaknesses in the way CHCs have been operating up until now. How can the system become more effective in future - what have you achieved since the Longley review?\nSince the Longley Review of CHCs was published in 2012, our board has been working hard to address the recommendations made in this important report.\nThe most recent Welsh government consultation on our regulations has taken account of these. In future the seven CHCs across Wales will be working to consistent standards, but at the same time maintaining our local \"reach\", sensitive to local differences. The CHC board will monitor these standards.\nWe have already reviewed our advocacy service and work is in hand to introduce common standards to this important service, as well as our inspection and engagement functions.\nWe will also be developing our relationships with other bodies like HIW, CSSIW and the Older People's Commissioner - that has been a weakness in the past. We have now produced a statement of strategic intent, which will focus our functional development over the period 2015-2018.\nHow exactly will you strengthen collaboration with other health bodies like the Health Inspectorate Wales?\nWe have already developed a protocol with HIW which allows for regular and routine exchange of information and intelligence and the potential for joint inspections. In 2014, we carried out a number of GP inspections across Wales together and we will look to mount more of these. This will be formally exchanged at our annual conference in Cardiff.\nWork is also ongoing with the Older People's Commissioner to examine how we can more effectively represent the interests of care home residents.\nDoes Prof June Andrews's report and other examples of concerns about standards of care demonstrate weaknesses?\nUnfortunately they do. The NHS is a human service and occasionally things go wrong. When they do, we need to acknowledge and recognise them and ensure that they form part of the learning process to prevent them happening again.\nMany of the recent reviews, like the Andrews' Report and the Evans' Review comment that health boards must have intimate contact with what is happening on their frontline - the wards for instance.

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nA beautifully controlled half-volley from Jonny Hayes after nine minutes was reward for a fine Dons start.\nBut Celtic were level within two minutes as Stuart Armstrong was given too much time to pick out the far corner from the edge of the box.\nLate Celtic pressure paid off as Rogic fired low past goalkeeper Joe Lewis.\nA thrilling 90 minutes concluded with Celtic not only lifting the cup for the first time since 2013 but becoming the first side in Scotland to complete an unbeaten treble.\nIt is the 37th time the Hoops have lifted the world's oldest national football trophy and the fourth time they have won the treble - and their first since 2001.\nDerek McInnes' Dons, looking to end a 27-year wait to win the competition for an eighth time, were left as runners-up to Brendan Rodgers' side in the Premiership, the League Cup and now the Scottish Cup.\nIt was a pulsating cup final right from the start, Aberdeen coming out with an edge to their play that put their illustrious rivals on the back foot.\nYes, Rodgers' team had won five out of five in the head-to-heads this season, with an aggregate score of 12-2, but this was an altogether different Dons to previous versions.\nIn this classic, they were a team reborn.\nIn the beginning, they harried Celtic's go-to men. Graeme Shinnie and Kenny McLean were commanding.\nThey lived in their faces defensively and showed plenty offensively. The feeling was that Aberdeen had to take the lead to make a true fight of this final and that is precisely what they did.\nHaving shipped three early goals to Celtic in their last meeting, the Dons changed the narrative.\nFrom a Niall McGinn corner, Hayes came round the blindside of Leigh Griffiths and smashed a volley past goalkeeper Craig Gordon and beyond Kieran Tierney on the line.\nIt was a goal of quality and a goal that electrified the huge Aberdeen support.\nCeltic are champions, though, and their true selves emerged only two minutes later when Aberdeen unwisely stood off Armstrong, who thumped in the equaliser low to Lewis's left.\nTwo early goals and the intensity only cranked up from there. Midway through the half, there was controversy.\nJayden Stockley - selected up front ahead of Adam Rooney - swung an arm into Tierney's face and the young Celtic full-back immediately signalled that he was in bother.\nBlood poured from his mouth and, after treatment, he had to leave the field.\nStockley has a reputation for over-zealous use of his arms and elbows and was deeply fortunate not to see red for a fourth time this season. He claimed it was accidental, but Celtic were having none of it. They were incensed.\nCallum McGregor shifted to left-back and Rogic came into the final and things went up another level.\nGordon made a double save in quick order and then made another from a Stockley header.\nCeltic were rattled, they were totally unable to get a hold of the game in the face of the Dons' aggressive edge.\nIt was Celtic, however, who should have gone ahead just before the break when a delicious Griffiths delivery was put over from point-blank range by Scott Sinclair.\nThe toe-to-toe nature of the contest carried on brilliantly. Griffiths and Sinclair went close then Aberdeen swept downfield on a breakaway and a priceless chance was wasted.\nHayes had mugged McGregor down the right and, with McLean running free in the box, all they had to do was get their communication right and a goal was certain.\nThey didn't.

The game opened up as wide as the Clyde.\nAberdeen's Ash Taylor headed away from under his own crossbar, Dedryck Boyota headed just over, Gordon made a fine save from Shinnie and then it was Lewis's turn again, saving wonderfully from Griffiths. Lewis was immense for the Dons.\nAs the final wore on, Celtic took an ever-tightening grip.\nRodgers' side pressed and pressed and a tiring Aberdeen threw their bodies in front of shots to keep alive. Their scrambling defence was constant and heroic.\nBut it wasn't enough. With all at Hampden steeling themselves for extra-time, Rogic ran at Aberdeen down the right, going past the utterly jaded Andrew Considine and slamming his shot low under Lewis.

It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism,\" he said.\nHe said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having \"more cohesive and integrated communities\".\nHome Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go \"uncontested\" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities \"from the mainstream\".\nShe said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine.\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans.\nSecretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would \"reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a 'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country\".\n\"These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,\" he said.\nDr Shafi also said he detected \"McCarthyist undertones\" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists.\nMr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a \"missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community\".\nBut Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could \"help in the battle against those who promote extremism\".\nRobin Brant, BBC political correspondent\nAt the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law.\nGetting inciteful content off the web and getting \"counter narrative\" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered.\nThere has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about.\nThe process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing.\nOn the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy.\nThe government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right.\nPolice estimate at least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, such as the so-called Islamic State, and the government believes tackling non-violent extremism is key to stemming the flow of people.\nParents of children aged under 16 have had the power to request the cancellation of passports - even where a child has taken or hidden the actual document - since July.\nThat power is being extended to parents of 16 and 17-year-olds, allowing families to contact a passport office where officials will investigate their concerns before a final decision is taken by the home secretary.\nMrs May said the measure had only been used by \"a small number\" of parents since July, but it was part of a package of new powers that would help tackle extremism.\nShadow policing minister Jack Dromey said it was \"crucial we get the balance right\" and that Mr Cameron must \"be very careful not to use the language he used earlier in the summer that somehow the Muslim community is not standing up to terrorism\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcements amounted to \"rhetoric that may well divide communities and make our job of working with those communities to find and isolate terrorists and potential terrorists that much harder\".",

He was a hero to Rubens Barrichello, who grew up metres from the race track and forged his passion watching Senna there, before graduating to F1 a couple of years before his death, befriending him, and then taking up his mantle. Felipe Massa, another local boy, followed suit.\nThe fans know the glory days have long gone, that a Brazilian victory is as unlikely as a day without a traffic jam in one of the world's most crowded cities.\nBut still they come, packing the grandstands and singing and chanting from early in the day.\nWhat draws them there? A deep-seated passion for the sport, for one. The almost-certainty of a great sporting spectacle, for another.\nInterlagos has a knack for producing exciting races. Drama is synonymous with the track, not least because of its position at the business end of the season.\nIt is a claustrophobic place. The circuit winds around a natural amphitheatre, high on a hill, the sprawl of Sao Paulo both a backdrop and crushing in from all sides. The heavy humidity, and almost-permanent threat of rain, add to the atmosphere.\nIt feels locked in, and not just because of the cramped old paddock, a fraction of the size of anything Bernie Ecclestone finds acceptable these days.\nThe track is a splash of vibrant green in an ocean of concrete grey and smog brown; the city butting up against the perimeter fence, endless tower blocks filling the skyline.\nTwenty years ago, a favela sprawled up the hill all the way to the perimeter wall. There has been an attempt to spruce things up a bit, the old corrugated-roof shacks replaced by flats closest to the circuit, houses of naked breeze blocks a bit further down the road. But down at heel, to say the least, it remains.\nThere is an unmistakable edge. The road up to Interlagos is not a place for a stranger to linger.\nInside, the track feels like a haven. One of the shortest laps on the calendar somehow packs in a long straight - superb for overtaking - and a challenging sequence of long corners, the best the uphill double right-hander of Ferra Dura/Laranha and the fast downhill left of Mergulho. It's a great race track, with emphasis on the \"race\".\nThey are corners with a history - the new track is about half of the old one. Part of a previous era, it was a magnificent five miles of twists and turns, uphill and down, which started with two incredible, banked, high-speed left-handers, taken absolutely flat out by some, still visible outside the modern Turns One, Two and Three.\nIt all adds to the character of the place. Loud, intimidating, crazy, invigorating, rough-around-the-edges.

Spain are hoping to retain the title they won in 2008 and 2012.\nEngland will be appearing at their ninth finals, while Wales and Northern Ireland have qualified for the first time.\nGood question - because, for the first time, there are 24 teams competing in the finals. That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996.\nWith six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers. In other words, only eight teams will fail to qualify from the group stage.\nOne point could be enough to put your team into the last 16 - and from then the tournament goes to a knockout format.\nAs Greece proved by pulling off a sensational triumph at Euro 2004, trying to predict a winner is a difficult game.\nWorld champions Germany are understandably one of the favourites, while holders Spain are also short odds with the bookmakers.\nGermany finished top of their qualification group but booking their place in France was not without its hiccups - with defeats by Poland and the Republic of Ireland. They have been beaten by France and England since qualifying but remain one to watch.\nSpain dominated international football between 2008 and 2012 but failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup. Could this be a last hurrah for Vicente del Bosque's ageing but brilliant side?\nFrance won the World Cup as hosts in 1998 - can they repeat the famous success of the team led by Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Laurent Blanc?\nA run into the latter stages by Les Bleus is likely to help restore national morale in a country still recovering from last year's deadly Paris attacks.\nFrance are the bookmakers' favourites to win the whole thing, but their form is tricky to gauge because they did not have to qualify for this tournament.\nFast on the counter and unified after years of internal division, watch out for talented midfielders Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi.\nBut they cannot call upon prolific Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The French Football Federation (FFF) said he would not be picked after being investigated for his part in an alleged plot to blackmail Les Bleus team-mate Mathieu Valbuena, who did not make the squad.\nWell, there are three of them in France - only Scotland missed out - plus the Republic of Ireland. It is going to get crowded too, because England and Wales are both in Group B, along with Russia and debutants Slovakia.\nDon't expect much work to get done when England and Wales play each other - that match in Lens will be shown live on BBC One, kick-off 14:00 BST, on Thursday, 16 June.\nRoy Hodgson's England have a good young team but doubts persist about their defence. They breezed through their qualifying group with a perfect record of 10 wins, while confidence was further boosted with March's impressive win away at world champions Germany.\nWales have got Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and plenty of heart. Chris Coleman's side reached their first major tournament in 57 years after losing just once in qualification.\nNorthern Ireland might have numerous players from England's lower leagues but they finished top of their qualifying group, losing just one of their 10 matches.\nStriker Kyle Lafferty could not get a game for club side Norwich during qualifying (he has since been loaned to Birmingham) but he scored seven crucial goals in nine games for his country.\nWith the 24-team format offering hope to traditionally less-successful nations, five countries have taken advantage to secure their European Championship finals debut.\nNorthern Ireland and Wales, of course, are two of them.\nSlovakia, who have been drawn alongside England and Wales in Group B, have qualified for the first time as an independent state. A 1-0 win against Spain showed the 2010 World Cup qualifiers can mix it with Europe's elite. Beware England and Wales.\nAlbania have never been near a major finals, but edged out Denmark - the 1992 champions - in their qualifying group thanks to a shock win in Portugal. Oh, and because they were awarded a 3-0 win in Serbia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot.\nWith a population of roughly 330,000 (comparable to Coventry) and only 21,508 registered players, Iceland are unsurprisingly the smallest nation to ever qualify for the finals.\nHow did they do that? By beating the Netherlands - 1988 winners and three-time semi-finalists - home and away during qualifying. The Dutch, for the first time since 1984, will not be there.\nReal Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who was voted the world's second best player behind Argentina's Lionel Messi in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote, heads a star-studded cast.\nRonaldo will be leading Portugal's challenge, while Wales hope his club-mate Gareth Bale - the world's most expensive player - can transform his impressive La Liga form onto the international stage.\nWorld Cup winners Germany boast a host of stellar names who have impressed in previous tournaments, most notably Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller plus Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos.\nFrance's challenge is set to be driven by energetic Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who is still reportedly courting the attention of several English Premier League sides.\nBelgium are not short of star quality either. Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne will spearhead their quest for a first major tournament win, but the Red Devils are without injured captain Vincent Kompany.\nAnd Sweden superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 34, will be hoping to illuminate an international tournament for what could be the final time.\nThe Netherlands' failure to qualify leaves Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben watching from home, while his club-mate Franck Ribery was not named in the France squad, despite suggestions he was considering ending his international retirement.\nThe tournament's 51 games will be staged at 10 locations across France, including new stadiums in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Nice.\nThe opening match - between France and Romania on 10 June - and the 10 July final will be played at the Stade de France in Paris.\nBuilding the new venues and renovating historic grounds such as Marseille's Stade Velodrome has cost 1.6bn euros (£1.2bn) - modernisation which was necessary, organisers say, because France did not fully capitalise on hosting the 1998 World Cup.\nVibrating stands, floating roofs and adjacent slag heaps - read BBC Sport's venue-by-venue guide\nIn March this year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) ratified a host of revisions to the laws of the game in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and meet the needs of the modern game. The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016.\nMore than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes:\nKick-off: Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction.\nPre-match red cards: Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad.\nLeaving the pitch after treatment: If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players.\nThe end of 'triple punishment': A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct.\nGoalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016.\nYes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out.\nHowever, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each.\nFind the latest ticket details on Uefa's official Euro 2016 website\nEach of the 10 host cities will have official Uefa fan zones.

    "document": "One of the first out of the blocks is a touring production of All My Sons by black-led theatre company Talawa.\nThe story centres on all-American couple Joe and Kate Keller, whose son is missing after World War Two.\nIts director Michael Buffong tells arts correspondent Tim Masters what makes the play a 20th Century classic.\nWhat does it mean to you to be taking All My Sons on the road in Miller's centenary year?\nThe fact that it's a centenary year shines an even brighter spotlight on what is an amazing piece of work and an amazing writer.\nWe originally performed this in 2013 and I'd love to say I planned the tour for the centenary, but the truth of it is that it's a coincidence.\nWhat makes All My Sons an American classic?\nThe themes are so universal. On one level it's about chasing the dream and the cost of trying to live it. The themes that come out of the play are issues of loyalty and trust and betrayal, and secrets within families and how people collude and how ultimately everything can come falling down.\nThe themes are so universal - what would you do for your family? Joe Keller thinks anything is forgivable because it's been done for his family but he doesn't have a wider social responsibility. That's his downfall.\nThe 2013 production earned five star reviews - does that add pressure to taking it out two years later?\nI haven't thought about it. If I did I might not sleep too well. I guess it might add a bit of pressure.\nI read reviews, you can't help it. One has to be able to take them - the good and the bad.\nGiven that it was such a hit, how much are you tweaking this time round?\nLike with any fantastic play once you get to revisit it you realise its depth - we are finding so many new things. Half the cast are different so it can't be the same because they bring new elements. It just goes to show the quality of the text: there's always more to unearth.\nDoes having a black cast give the play a new perspective?\nIt certainly gives it a nuance. If you think of a black family trying to achieve the American dream suddenly the stakes become higher still because of black history in the US.\nBut it essentially remains the same story: it's a family drama, and this family is an all-American family.\nYou took over Talawa in 2012 - are there still things you want to achieve?\nI'm just at the beginning. The past three years have been great and we are starting to achieve some of things we set out to do. It's great that we get do do All My Sons, and we get to work with the companies like the  National Theatre as we did last year with Moon on a Rainbow Shawl.\nWe've got a writers' programme working with the Bush and Soho Theatres and the BBC, and we have a space we are desperate to develop into a 100-seat venue. We are looking for funding to do that.\nWhat's the latest on workshops you've had with Lenny Henry on a play about the American comedian Richard Pryor?\nWe are still in the workshopping process. It's in development. I hope it will come to the stage. We are both keen to see it happen.\nAll My Sons, with a cast led by Ray Shell and Dona Croll, has opened at Ipswich's New Wolsey Theatre, and tours until 25 April. A full list of tour dates is on the Talawa website.\nFollowing its sell-out run at the Young Vic, A View from the Bridge, with Mark Strong leading the cast, opens at the West End's Wyndham's Theatre on 16 February, and is now in preview.\nThe RSC's production of Miller's 1949 Pulitzer prize-winning Death of a Salesman begins previews in March at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Antony Sher and Alex Hassell as father and son, Willy Loman and Biff.\nSian Phillips leads the cast of Sheffield Theatres' revival of Arthur Miller's Playing for Time from 12 March - 4 April at the Crucible.\nA drama originally written by Miller for the big screen, The Hook - about corruption in New York's docks - has its world premiere at Northampton's Royal and Derngate theatre on 5-27 June.",

    "document": "Opposition leader Gordon Bajnai never once raises his voice, despite the roar of the crowd behind him.\nIn the face of the opinion polls, he insists: \"We are flying blind in these elections. Opinion polls were invented for normal democracies. If democracy becomes limited, then surveys are of limited value too.\"\nAs leader of Together 2014, a centrist opposition movement, he is running in these elections as part of an uneasy coalition of leftist, liberal and green parties, trying to oust the popular and populist Prime Minister, Viktor Orban. His last hope is that the many people fed up with Mr Orban will find just enough in the opposition programme to vote for.\nMr Bajnai's vision of Mr Orban's Hungary is a dark one of a country\nFerenc Kumin looks out from his first-floor window in the south wing of the Hungarian parliament onto a very different Hungary.\nAs spokesman of the Fidesz government, he is inordinately proud of the vast, newly landscaped square, of the new metro line under the city (begun by the liberals, completed by Fidesz) but above all by his government's record in office.\n\"Hungary is performing better!\" is the message plastered on the country's buses, trams and roadside billboards for the past months - long before the election campaign started.\nMr Kumin has the figures to prove it:\nViktor Orban has decided not to publish a party programme for this election, preferring the simpler message: \"We cut utility bills\".\nA swingeing 30% cut in gas bills has proven rather popular with consumers.\nThe opposition says Hungary's 27% value added tax - the highest in Europe - harms their standard of living far more.\nMr Kumin rebuts Gordon Bajnai's allegations one by one. Democracy is alive and well in Hungary, he insists. The main criticisms by European institutions of the media law and the new constitution were addressed with amendments.\nAll parties agreed that Hungary needed a smaller, more streamlined parliament, and that is what has been achieved - without gerrymandering, he says.\nThe cuts in utility bills, he says, are part of the Fidesz philosophy to stand up for households against big businesses which overcharge consumers. And the big loan from Russia to build new nuclear reactors, he believes, will make it possible to keep electricity prices down.\nBudapest does look beautiful in the spring sunshine. Tourists flock here in ever greater numbers. Cruise liners plough the River Danube. The newly paved area around the parliament building lacks trees but is otherwise impeccable. An army of street sweepers swoops on each chocolate wrapper before it hits the ground.\nJapanese tourists flock enthusiastically to watch the raising of the Hungarian flag each morning and its lowering at dusk. The new metro station at Kalvin Square is a science-fiction extravaganza. Gellert Square, a marvel of mosaics.\nAt least 150,000 (pro-government media said 500,000) government supporters turned out for the final Fidesz rally in Heroes Square to hear Viktor Orban exhort the faithful. This is nothing less than a love affair with a charismatic leader for whom the centrist opposition has no answer.\nOnly the radical nationalist Jobbik party outdoes Viktor Orban with its promise to defend Hungary from interference from Brussels. Jobbik shares Viktor Orban's conversion to nuclear energy, but combines it with a pro-Russian rhetoric not heard in Hungary since the early 1950s.\nAccording to Jobbik MP Marton Gyongyosi, the recent referendum in Crimea on leaving Ukraine was a model of self-determination. But he firmly denies allegations that his party is partly financed by Russian state or private sources.\nWhile Jobbik hopes to swell its 16.7% score four years ago to over 20% this time, Hungary's main Green Party, LMP, which stands for Politics Can Be Different, is struggling to cross the 5% threshold needed to remain in parliament.\nThe increasingly crude mud-slinging between Fidesz and the centrist bloc in the last days of the campaign could boost votes for both Jobbik and the LMP.",

His last such appearance was in Sydney where he was defending his local church against accusations of covering up paedophile priest scandals.\nCardinal Pell admitted he was not \"nimble\" in Italian. The domination by Italians of the Roman Curia, the central government of the Roman Catholic Church, which has lasted centuries, is slowly being eroded under the leadership of the dynamic new Pope from Argentina.\nThe Pope's English is not fluent, but he understands his fellow cardinals' and bishops' desire for a more truly universal Catholic Church with top level appointments from every continent.\nThe bank's profits fell last year to 2.9m euros from 86.6m euros in 2012.\nIts precarious financial situation was revealed by the simultaneous publication in Rome of balance sheets for 2013 of the Holy See, of the Vatican City state, a separate entity, and of the Vatican bank, known officially as the Institute for Religious Works (IOR).\nThe IOR moves money around the world to finance Catholic missions and provides banking services for the Pope, clergy and religious orders.\nAlongside the bank's massive drop in profits, the Holy See, the administrative headquarters of the Church, ran up a deficit of 24.2m euros (Â£19.2m) last year.\nHowever Vatican City state, the tiny sovereign enclave in the heart of Rome, which derives a large part of its income from tickets to the Vatican museums, reported a profit of 32.3m euros (Â£25.7m).\nThe bank's losses were attributed in part to writedowns of investments made before the bank's reform programme started and when less vigilance was exercised.\nThe cost of bringing in American anti-money laundering experts to comb through and vet some 18,000 individual accounts at the Vatican amounted to 7.3m euros.\nIn an interview with the BBC's David Willey in his Vatican bank office, Mr von Freyberg said he had discovered \"only small\" skeletons in the cupboards of the IOR during his term of office.\n\"There is much less to the IOR than people think. We are smaller than most small town savings and loans [banks] in the world and the same is true of our skeletons.\"\n\"Whatever we found is much smaller than you might believe reading up about the Vatican bank in the media,\" he added.\nAccording to the IOR website, the total assets of the Vatican bank amount to 5.9 billion euros.\nUnder Mr von Freyberg's management some 3,000 customer relationships have been terminated, leaving about 15,000 current accounts active.",

The problem about switching to digital is that the big British print newspapers bring in revenues in hundreds of millions of pounds while even the best digital products make only tens of millions.\nThe long decline in print readership has led to many declarations that print will be dead in a few years' time, but until a way is found to make more money out of digital, they will hang on to their print readers to the very end.\nESI said the number of staff affected would be \"confirmed following a consultation period\".\nIt said a \"significant number\" of staff would move to Johnston Press, which also own the Scotsman, the Yorkshire Post and some 250 other local and regional newspapers, as part of the sale of the i newspaper.\nThe closure of the Independent's print editions will have \"no bearing on the status\" of the London Evening Standard - also owned by ESI - the company added.\nThe Independent's editor Amol Rajan tweeted: \"Impossible to over-state how proud I am of the most dedicated, clever, industrious and brave staff in the history of Fleet St.\"\nThe Independent was set up in 1986, and at its peak had a circulation of more than 400,000 copies, but December's figures showed it lagging far behind rival national newspapers.\nRussian billionaire Alexander Lebedev took control of the loss-making newspapers in 2010 when he bought Independent News for Media for Â£1.\nIn 2014, his son Evgeny told the BBC the Independent could be sold if someone \"offers the right price\" - but he was \"not actively trying to sell it\".\nThe first front page of the Independent was written by Mark Urban, now BBC Newsnight's diplomatic correspondent, a 25-year-old \"young stripling\".\n\"I went there because I was inspired\", he said. \"Their mission was to be the best. I thought it was a noble mission, and even if it all goes horribly wrong, it's worth a try.\"\nMany experienced journalists were among those who risked their careers and turned up \"with typewriters\" to launch the title, he said.\n\"For four weeks before launch dates, there were dummy runs every day. There was a very strong sense of purpose.\"\nJournalists from other publications and broadcasters paid tribute to the title and its staff.\nITV political editor Robert Peston tweeted: \"Closure of @Independent as print title is heart-rending, terrible. Such an important paper in its day.\"\nThe BBC's Andrew Marr, a former editor of the Independent, replied: \"Not in its day, Robert. Its day is now!\"\nEditor of the Independent on Sunday Lisa Markwell tweeted some of the paper's most memorable front pages, adding: \"My proudest professional achievement has been to preside over the brilliant, brave @IndyOnSunday team for 3 years.\"\nStephen Glover, a co-founder of the Independent, said the paper was selling \"so few copies that it doesn't really make sense to go on printing it every day\".\nSpeaking on Thursday - before the move was confirmed - he told BBC Newsnight: \"If it is true then I think it will be the first of many papers which stop their print editions and have another existence online.\"\nHe said the Financial Times and the Guardian could also stop producing print editions \"within the next few years\", and in 10 to 15 years there would not be \"very many\" printed newspapers.\nMr Glover said there was a \"longer question\" about whether online-only papers could support the same number of journalists and do the \"same sort of journalism\" as printed ones.\nThe Times' media editor Beth Rigby said the industry had been in turmoil for many years, \"and now we're beginning to see the hard end of that\", adding that the Guardian and Telegraph were also facing major changes.\nWriting in the Guardian's website, professor of journalism Brian Cathcart predicted that all UK national newspapers would eventually go out of print.\nHe added: \"No-one can say in what order it will happen, but it will happen to the most venerable titles, even to the top-selling Sun and Mail.\"",

    "document": "The weather phenomenon is set to exacerbate droughts in some areas, while increasing flooding in others.\nSome of the worst impacts are likely in Africa with food shortages expected to peak in February.\nRegions including the Caribbean, Central and South America will also be hit in the next six months.\nThis periodic weather event, which tends to drive up global temperatures and disturb weather patterns, has helped push 2015 into the record books as the world's warmest year.\n\"By some measures this has already been the strongest El Nino on record. It depends on exactly how you measure it,\" said Dr Nick Klingaman from the University of Reading.\n\"In a lot of tropical countries we are seeing big reductions in rainfall of the order of 20-30%. Indonesia has experienced a bad drought; the Indian monsoon was about 15% below normal; and the forecasts for Brazil and Australia are for reduced monsoons.\"\nAs both droughts and floods continue, the scale of the potential impacts is worrying aid agencies. Around 31 million people are said to be facing food insecurity across Africa, a significant increase over the last year.\nAround a third of these people live in Ethiopia where 10.2 million are projected to require humanitarian assistance in 2016.\nCan Ethiopia cope with drought?\nSouth Africa grapples with worst drought in 30 years\nEl Nino is a naturally occurring weather episode that sees the warm waters of the central Pacific expand eastwards towards North and South America.\nIt was originally recognised by fishermen off the coast of South America in the 1600s with the appearance of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean. El Nino translates as Little Boy, or Christ Child.\nThe phenomenon, which happens every two to seven years, usually peaks late in the calendar year, although the effects can persist well into the following spring and last up to 12 months.\nEl Nino is part of what is known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle - the opposite phase of the cycle is called La Nina. La Nina is sometimes referred to as the cold phase and El Nino the warm phase\nThe current El Nino episode is the strongest event since 1998 and is expected to be among the three most powerful ever recorded. According to the WMO, the peak three month average water surface temperatures in tropical Pacific are expected to exceed 2C above normal.\nStrongest El Nino since 1950 on the way\nMatt McGrath: 'High impacts' from globally stronger El Nino\nThe UK's Department for International Development says (DfID) it is providing emergency support for 2.6 million people and 120,000 malnourished children. It says it will provide 8 million people with food or cash support from January 2016.\n\"If we fail to act now against this especially powerful El Nino, we will fail vulnerable people across our world,\" UK International Development Minister Nick Hurd said in a statement.\n\"Ensuring security for those affected by El Nino is important to their countries but also in Britain's national interest. Only by protecting and stabilising vulnerable countries can we ensure people are not forced to leave their homes in search of food or a new livelihood.\"\nAccording to the UN, around 60 million people have been forced to leave their homes because of conflict.\nAid agencies like Oxfam are worried that the impacts of the continuing El Nino in 2016 will add to existing stresses such as the wars in Syria, South Sudan and Yemen.\nThey say that food shortages are likely to peak in Southern Africa in February with Malawi estimating that almost three million people will require humanitarian assistance before March.\nDrought and erratic rains have affected two million people across Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. More floods are expected in Central America in January.\n\"Millions of people in places like Ethiopia, Haiti and Papua New Guinea are already feeling the effects of drought and crop failure,\" said Jane Cocking, from Oxfam.\n\"We urgently need to get help to these areas to make sure people have enough food and water.\n\"We cannot afford to allow other large-scale emergencies to develop elsewhere. If the world waits to respond to emerging crises in southern Africa and Latin America, we will not be able to cope,\" she said.\nWhile many parts of the developing world will more directly feel the ongoing impacts of El Nino, the developed world will see impacts on food prices.\n\"It takes some time for the impacts of El Nino to feed through to social and economic systems,\" said Dr Klingaman.\n\"Historically food prices have gone up by 5%-10% for staples. Crops like coffee and rice and cocoa and sugar tend to be particularly affected.\"\nThe El Nino event is likely to tail off into the spring - but that may not be good news either.\nEl Ninos are often followed by La Nina events, which can have opposite but similarly harmful effects. Scientists say during an El Nino there is a huge transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. Normally, as in 1997/98, that heat transfer tends to be followed by a cooling of the ocean, a La Nina event,\n\"It's possible but far from certain that this time next year we could be talking about the reverse of many of these impacts,\" said Dr Klingaman.\n\"In places where we are seeing droughts from El Nino, we could be seeing flooding from La Nina next year.\n\"It's just as disruptive, it's just the other way round.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.",

    "document": "As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food.\nIn BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years.\nShe was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health.\nFollowing a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma.\nWhen she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks.\nDuring an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud.\nIt is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers.\nEmma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day.\nOne of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices.\nDespite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state.\n\"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years,\" she said.\n\"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health.\n\"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume.\n\"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up.\"\nThe evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing.\nA landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology.\nPlus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks.\nUnfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients.\nThis has to change.\nMany of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up.\nWhen we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term.\nBut, this can actually make things worse in the long term.\nThe food you are eating is literally \"shocking\" your body.\nBy changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks.\nShe also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress.\nIt has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health.\nOf course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional.\nThere can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood.\nAs a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you:\n1. Reduce sugar and processed foods\nSugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise.\nWithin two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall.\nAt this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel \"h-angry\" as well - hungry and angry.\nLow and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.\nThis can have a negative impact on your mood.\n2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats\nThis is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.\nFoods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables.\n3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts\nTryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter.\nEat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood.\n4. Feed your gut bugs\nSome scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers.\nIt is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis.\nThe prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.\nBest options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.\nYou have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.\nSee how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 21:00 BST on BBC One.",

Baby number two, a boy, is due in July.\n\"Putting the health of the baby first doesn't just mean sitting on the couch,\" the 29-year-old said.\nWhy it's OK to run when you are pregnant\nVollmer isn't the first woman to race while heavily pregnant - in June 2014, Alysia Montano competed in the 800m quarter finals of the US track and field championships while eight months pregnant.\nPlenty of women have also taken part in the Olympics while pregnant, though none did in Rio, due to concerns over the effect of the Zika virus on unborn children.\nThe website of the US Swimming Masters, an organisation helping promote the sport, advises that women can carry on swimming even while heavily pregnant, but that each case is different.\nCompeting in the 50 metres freestyle only three months before giving birth did present one particular challenge for Vollmer.\n\"I don't think I've ever done a 50 where I took four or five breaths,\" she said. \"A 50 felt long for the first time in my life.\"\nIn the end, Vollmer finished 55th in the preliminary round in Mesa, with a time of 27.59 seconds (last year, she swam the same race in 25 seconds).\nNot that her time was a problem.\n\"Time didn't matter, place didn't matter,\" she said. \"I've loved being here. I've loved seeing all my teammates, all the people from Rio. The race felt great.\"",

    "document": "This weekend will be my first outing at the Stade Jean-Bouin as I didn't take part last year. Those that did play recall tricolours aplenty and a rousing French crowd who were enjoying sevens rugby in Paris for the first time since 2006.\nWith South Africa 25 points clear at the top of the standings with two tournaments to play, they only need to make the quarter-finals to secure the overall series title.\nSamoa shocked a few people when they claimed victory in Paris last year, coached by Damian McGrath. He now coaches Canada, who claimed a well-deserved but unanticipated victory in Singapore in the last round.\nThis weekend, the series welcomes newly qualified Spain. They won the qualification tournament in Hong Kong and will compete as a core side on the tour next season, having played in the Olympics last summer. They are a passionate group and will be a tough opposition for us as we meet them in our first group game on Saturday.\nThe grand finale will again take place in London on 20 and 21 May. Returning to Twickenham for the 10th and last leg of the series is a particularly special occasion for us in the England team.\nSetting foot on the hallowed - and incredibly well kept - turf at the home of rugby is a dream for many young players in England and it was no different for me. There is part of me that still feels awestruck when I allow myself to picture that moment standing in the tunnel leading the team out in front of the home crowd. The eight-year-old me playing at East Grinstead Rugby Club didn't even dream this big.\nThe London Sevens also provides a rare opportunity for us to play in front of friends and family. 90% of our playing time is overseas and, while this allows us to connect with fantastic support for England around the world, our friends and family only enjoy the experience on TV. So this is the occasion when we get to truly share the excitement of the journey with our loved ones.\nThe roar we get at Twickenham is like no other. A pre-tournament treat for our home leg is choosing which song will play when we take the field, but whatever we choose, the music is lost in the sound of cheering fans and this is the most motivating song we could ask for.\nIn 15-a-side rugby, the difference between players' positions and roles is very clear. This is not always so obvious in sevens, where you have to be a bit of a jack of all trades - everyone must tackle, pass well, achieve certain speeds (minimum 32kph) etc.\nLoosely we can divide up a squad into four categories - playmakers (scrum-half, fly-half), strike runners (centres, wings), enforcers (props), and link player/fetcher (hooker). I'm a playmaker, and we are responsible for running the attack and manipulating defences. Often the playmakers are also the kickers and sweep behind the line in defence.\nThe strike runners, such as Dan Norton, are the headline grabbers. They specialise in hot stepping and high speeds, and can hit speeds in excess of 37kph, which is over 10m per second. Tom Bowen utilises both of these attributes brilliantly to beat defenders.\nThe enforcers are often the big boys, but even the props in sevens will run 1,200m in just over four minutes. These guys are often the bosses at the set piece and are also the physical presence in attack and defence.\nThe link player/fetchers are most commonly the hookers. Often these guys are the dogs - putting their heads in tackles and rucks for 14 minutes. \"Housewives' favourite\" Phil Burgess is an ever-present in this role and so these guys need to have a good engine.\nOne player missing out on Paris through injury is Richard de Carpentier. He has been a force to be reckoned with on the World Series this year, terrorising opposition with his steam-train carrying and wrecking-ball defence.\nOn and off the field, \"Chippy\" enjoys a witty quip. At scrum time he has been known to have a jibe at the opposition prop and he is always on the lookout for a joke. Just don't steal his tea bags otherwise you'll see a different side to him.\nAppropriately, Rich picked up the award this week for England Sevens player of the year at the RPA awards. I am sure he is \"dead chuffed\" (his words, said like a true Lancashire lad).",

How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script',\" he said.\n\"We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time.\n\"We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point.\n\"We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints.\n\"We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game.\n\"The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other.\n\"One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything. So far that has been the case.\"",

That is the highest level since records began in 1971.\nThat means 307,000 more people are in employment in the UK, compared with the same time last year.\nLatest unemployment figures across the UK\nThe ONS's David Freeman said two-thirds of this increase had been seen in UK nationals. A third of the employment increase came from non-UK nationals working in the UK.\nSuddenly everyone is watching out for the unemployment rate. That's because the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has said future interest rate rises will not start until, barring unexpected events, the rate falls to 7% of the workforce.\nThe latest figures, the first since the Bank's forward guidance announcement, showed the rate was unchanged at 7.8%.  Yet the figures also showed the number in work was at a record high.  And therein lies a problem for the Bank.\nThe economy is creating jobs but the workforce is growing.  So there may be solid economic growth over the next couple of years, but the unemployment rate still takes a while to come down.  And during that time, inflation alarm bells may start to ring.\nAnalysts said the figures portrayed a mixed picture of the UK jobs market.\n\"Despite some good news in the latest jobs figures there are worrying signs about the underlying state of the UK jobs market,\" said John Philpott, from the think tank, The Jobs Economist.\n\"The rise in employment is almost matched by an increase in the size of the workforce, which means the unemployment rate is unchanged at 7.8%.\n\"The headline jobs figures may continue to be broadly positive but one only has to dig a little deeper into the statistics to see that millions of people are continuing to be hit by a combination of lack of jobs and a ceaseless sharp fall in the real value of their pay.\"\nYouth unemployment, among those aged 16-24, increased by 15,000 to reach 973,000.\nThe number of people out of work for more than two years also rose by 10,000 to 474,000, the highest number in 16 years.\nThe ONS also released figures showing that wages grew by 1.1% over the past 12 months. When bonuses were included, wages grew by 2.1% - the highest annual growth rate since June 2011.\nThe small fall in unemployment comes a week after Mr Carney linked the Bank of England's interest rate policy decisions to the unemployment rate for the first time.\nHe said the MPC will not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate falls below 7%, which he predicted would take about three years and the creation of 750,000 jobs.\nWork and Pensions minister Steve Webb told the BBC that \"things were starting to look much more positive\". He said the jobs figures added to a general picture of an economy that was starting to pick up.\nBut Labour's shadow employment minister, Stephen Timms, said the reality was that for ordinary families things were getting \"harder not easier\", highlighting the rise in part-time workers.\n\"Ministers just sound out of touch when they ignore the fact that the number of people who are working part-time because they cannot find a full-time job is at record levels,\" he said.",

The Council of State is an advisory body that aids and counsels the president.\nThe introduction of the legislation follows the case of an Indian woman who died in an Irish hospital after she was refused an abortion.\nThe debate revealed deep splits in the predominantly Catholic country.\nAnti-abortion campaigners say that the bill will allow the intentional killing of the unborn for the first time in the Republic of Ireland.\nOthers argue the bill is too limited as it does not allow for terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality or when the foetus cannot survive outside the womb.\nSince a Supreme Court ruling in the 1992 X case, abortion has been constitutionally available when a woman's life, as distinct from her health, is at risk from the continued pregnancy.\nX was a suicidal 14-year-old schoolgirl who had been raped by a neighbour and was initially prevented from leaving the country for an abortion in Britain.\nSince then, the credible threat of suicide is, constitutionally, regarded as grounds for a termination.\nBut until now, no government in the republic has introduced legislation to give doctors legal certainty on when an abortion can be carried out.\nThat uncertainty provided part of the context for the Savita Halappanavar case.\nShe was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who was admitted to hospital in Galway in October 2012 while miscarrying.\nShe died a week later from septicaemia.\nHer request for an abortion was turned down.\nHer inquest heard that she could not get a termination at the time because her life was not in danger but, by the time her life was at risk, an abortion would have been too late to save her.",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nNow, he has to find a replacement for the German as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton. And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task.\nSo who will be on Wolff's shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat?\nThis is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each.\nRound two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso.\nChances of it happening: 6/10\nThe Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it.\nBut he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary.\nChances: 6/10\nVerstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion.\nWolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo.\nChances: 4/10\nVettel's love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to \"earn\" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer.\nLikewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer.\nVettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso.\nChances of it happening: 8/10\nWolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it.\nNext year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams' engine fee.\nBut Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept? Felipe Nasr, who raced for Sauber in 2016, would also be an option for them, and please F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who needs a Brazilian in the sport to satisfy its largest single TV audience.\nChances: 9/10\nThe German is the obvious choice - he is Mercedes' reserve driver, he has tested for the team several times, and he is a free agent. But he has only one season's race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well.\nPutting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that's without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton.\nChances: 8/10\nAnother Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017.\nBut Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it's surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team.\nChances: 7/10\nA left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option.\nChances: 5/10\nButton has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport.\nChances: 1/10\nThe German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur.\nBut taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either.\nChances: 2/10",

    "document": "\"Industrial-strength\" extremists cannot be dealt with \"just with force of arms\", he said in a rare interview.\nDuring the Iraq war, Mr Petraeus devised the strategy that saw a \"surge\" in US troop numbers and secured support from Sunni tribesmen against al-Qaeda.\nIraq's US-backed army is now battling to retake territory seized by IS.\nGen Petraeus described the group as \"a formidable enemy\".\n\"It is really a conventional army that also has elements of an insurgency, and indeed significant terrorist elements as well,\" he said.\nBut when asked to compare IS with its predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq - which Gen Petraeus was instrumental in defeating - he said the latter \"had much greater roots in Iraq and much greater numbers than IS\".\nThe retired general characterised the recent capture by IS of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, as \"a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative of IS being on the defensive - of losing - was shown to be somewhat hollow\".\n\"I do think Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks or less,\" he added.\n\"But this was a big setback. At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now.\"\n1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army\n2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict\n2008: Head of US Central Command\n2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan\nMid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director\nNovember 2012: Resigns over affair\nAfter commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.\nSubsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge.\nBut despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years.\nHe was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.\nHe also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.\nNot surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.\nThe keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.\n\"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,\" he said.  \"You have to have that political component as well.\"\nPolitical change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, \"the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it\".\nAs to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.\n\"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,\" he insists.\n\"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.\"\nThat looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.\n\"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?\" he asks. \"Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?\n\"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?\"\nIt sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension.\n\"Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?\"\nIn response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.\n\"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans.\"\nGen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way.\nAnd he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region.\n\"This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony,\" he says.\nSo he believes that \"while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran\".\nGen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq.\nThat is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model.\nBut the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?",

    "document": "Although such an event should have been predicted and planned for, the panel said, it found gaping holes in safety standards and emergency procedures.\nHere is an outline of key quotes, findings and recommendations from the 88-page executive summary of the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission's report.\nThe earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011 were natural disasters of a magnitude that shocked the entire world. Although triggered by these cataclysmic events, the subsequent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant cannot be regarded as a natural disaster. It was a profoundly manmade disaster - that could and should have been foreseen and prevented...\nOur report catalogues a multitude of errors and wilful negligence that left the Fukushima plant unprepared for the events of March 11. And it examines serious deficiencies in the response to the accident by Tepco, regulators and the government.\nFor all the extensive detail it provides, what this report cannot fully convey - especially to a global audience - is the mindset that supported the negligence behind this disaster. What must be admitted - very painfully - is that this was a disaster \"Made in Japan.\"\nIts fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the program'; our groupism; and our insularity.\n(Chairman Kiyoshi Kurokawa)\nCollusion and lack of governance\nThe Tepco Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and [private plant operator] Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties. They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly \"manmade\"...\nWe believe that the root causes were the organizational and regulatory systems... rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual.\n[All parties] failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements - such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release.\nOrganisational problems within Tepco\nHad there been a higher level of knowledge, training, and equipment inspection related to severe accidents, and had there been specific instructions given to the on-site workers concerning the state of emergency within the necessary time frame, a more effective accident response would have been possible... Sections in the diagrams of the severe accident instruction manual were missing.\nEmergency response issues\nThe government, the regulators, Tepco management, and the Kantei [prime minister's office] lacked the preparation and the mindset to efficiently operate an emergency response to an accident of this scope. None, therefore, were effective in preventing or limiting the consequential damage.\nIn the critical period just after the accident, the Kantei did not promptly declare a state of emergency. The regional nuclear emergency response team was meant to be the contact between the Kantei and the operator, responsible for keeping the Kantei informed about the situation on the ground. Instead, the Kantei contacted Tepco headquarters and the Fukushima site directly, and disrupted the planned chain of command.\nEvacuation issues\nThe Commission concludes that the residents' confusion over the evacuation stemmed from the regulators' negligence and failure over the years to implement adequate measures against a nuclear disaster, as well as a lack of action by previous governments and regulators focused on crisis management. The crisis management system that existed for the Kantei and the regulators should protect the health and safety of the public, but it failed in this function.\nThe central government... failed to convey the severity of the accident... [O]nly 20% of the residents of the town hosting the plant knew about the accident when evacuation from the 3km zone was ordered at 21:23 on the evening of March 11.\nThere was great confusion over the evacuation, caused by prolonged shelter-in-place orders and voluntary evacuation orders. Some residents were evacuated to high dosage areas because radiation monitoring information was not provided.\nContinuing public health and welfare issues\n[R]esidents in the affected area are still struggling from the effects of the accident. They continue to face grave concerns, including the health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment. ...\nThe Commission concludes that the government and the regulators are not fully committed to protecting public health and safety; that they have not acted to protect the health of the residents and to restore their welfare.\nApproximately 150,000 people were evacuated in response to the accident... Insufficient evacuation planning led to many residents receiving unnecessary radiation exposure. Others were forced to move multiple times, resulting in increased stress and health risks - including deaths among seriously ill patients.\n\"If there had been even a word about a nuclear power plant when the evacuation was ordered, we could have reacted reasonably, taken our valuables with us or locked up the house before we had left. We had to run with nothing but the clothes we were wearing. It is such a disappointment every time we are briefly allowed to return home only to find out that we have been robbed again.\" (Comment by a resident of Okuma, from report appendices)\nRegulator failures\nThe regulators did not monitor or supervise nuclear safety... They avoided their direct responsibilities by letting operators apply regulations on a voluntary basis. Their independence from the political arena, the ministries promoting nuclear energy, and the operators was a mockery. They were incapable, and lacked the expertise and the commitment to assure the safety of nuclear power.\nOperator failures\nTepco did not fulfil its responsibilities as a private corporation, instead obeying and relying upon the government bureaucracy of Meti, the government agency driving nuclear policy. At the same time... it manipulated the cosy relationship with the regulators to take the teeth out of regulations.\nShortcomings in laws and regulations\nLaws and regulations related to nuclear energy have only been revised as stopgap measures, based on actual accidents. They have not been seriously and comprehensively reviewed in line with the accident response and safeguarding measures of an international standard. As a result, predictable risks have not been addressed.\nThe existing regulations primarily are biased toward the promotion of a nuclear energy policy, and not to public safety, health and welfare. The unambiguous responsibility that operators should bear for a nuclear disaster was not specified. There was also no clear guidance about the responsibilities of the related parties in the case of an emergency.\nNo 'cosmetic solutions'\nReplacing people or changing the names of institutions will not solve the problems. Unless these root causes are resolved, preventive measures against future similar accidents will never be complete...\nThe underlying issue is the social structure that results in \"regulatory capture,\" and the organisational, institutional, and legal framework that allows individuals to justify their own actions, hide them when inconvenient, and leave no records in order to avoid responsibility.",

    "document": "Below are some of the main points from Greece's list of reforms - contained in a letter from the Greek government to its European partners - alongside analysis and comment from BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker.\nAndrew Walker: Improving tax collection has been a persistent theme in the discussions between Greece and its bailout lenders. It's an area where it's easy to see a shared view between the two sides. The idea of getting the well-off to contribute to the financing of public policies is right in line with Syriza's wider agenda. Anything that brings in more revenue and so helps stabilise the government finances is likely to be welcome to the lenders as well. Creating a new culture of tax compliance is a bit \"motherhood and apple pie\". Who could object? But it will take a long time to achieve.\nAndrew Walker:The lenders are also likely to welcome the commitment to review every area of government spending and to identify cost savings.\nAndrew Walker:There is more motherhood and apple pie on tackling corruption, smuggling and money laundering. The aim is not controversial. But will they be able to achieve significant improvements?\nAndrew Walker: The line on privatisation is striking - accept those that have been completed and respect those that are underway. New cases are not ruled out, far from it. The letter only calls for an emphasis on maximising public revenue - which is after all one of the reasons there is a privatisation programme in the first place. How will this go down with Syriza, especially the left of the party? Even so the IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde isn't impressed on this point.  Privatisation is one of a number of areas where she notes \"a lack of unequivocal undertakings to continue already agreed policies\".\nAndrew Walker:Also on that list is labour market reforms, another area that Ms Lagarde of the IMF regards critical for Greece. Even so, the party is likely to be suspicious at best of some of the labour market stuff that is included. Linking the minimum wage with productivity and competitiveness could well limit the scope for raising it, which was a central element in the party's election offer.\nAndrew Walker: The independence of the statistical authority might play into the debt debate later. One idea has been to use growth-linked debt payments. That has more chance of getting off the ground if the growth data come from a genuinely independent and adequately resourced agency.\nAndrew Walker:The humanitarian crisis had to be in there in some form. It was so central to Syriza's political campaign. But the commitment to use non-pecuniary measures and to ensure the fight has no negative fiscal effect shows how hemmed in the Greek government is. It will be hard to land many blows with such constraints on how they can fight.",

Let's work instead,\" he said.\nMichel Temer became interim president as soon as Ms Rousseff was suspended.\nRead more on Michel Temer here\nMichel Temer also said he would support the sweeping investigation into corruption at state oil company Petrobras that has embroiled many politicians and officials.\nMr Temer has nominated a 22-strong cabinet.\nThere are no women, although two more names are expected to be added to the cabinet. Ms Rousseff had earlier suggested that sexism in the male-dominated Congress had played a key part in the impeachment process.\nMr Meirelles, the new finance minister, built a reputation for calming nerves in the markets when heading the central bank, and helped tame inflation to create one of the country's biggest economic booms.\nBut analysts say Mr Temer's popularity ratings are as bad as Ms Rousseff's and he faces many challenges.\nDuring the overnight debate, Senator Jose Serra, who has been named the new foreign minister, said the impeachment process was \"a bitter though necessary medicine\".\n\"Having the Rousseff government continue would be a bigger tragedy,\" he said.\nBrazil is suffering from its worst recession in 10 years, unemployment reached 9% in 2015 and inflation is at a 12-year high.\nIn her TV speech, flanked by ministers at the presidential palace, Ms Rousseff said that she may have made mistakes but had committed no crimes, adding: \"I did not violate budgetary laws.\"\nShe said: \"What is at stake is respect for the ballot box, the sovereign will of the Brazilian people and the constitution.\"\nBranding the process \"fraudulent\" and saying her government was \"undergoing sabotage\", she vowed to fight the charges against her and said she was confident she would be found innocent.\nHer removal ends 13 years of leftist rule.\nThe 180 days allocated for the trial to take place expire on 8 November.",

    "document": "Exeter Chiefs boss Rob Baxter also says a \"sacking culture\" comparable to football is creeping into rugby union.\nLeicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill became the third boss sacked in eight months on Monday, while five left in five years before 2016.\n\"It appears that coaches are a lot more vulnerable than they had been,\" said RCA founder and director Richard Moon.\nMoon, a former Harlequins scrum-half and Rugby Football Union committee member who established the forerunner to the Rugby Players' Association, said one of the main reasons for setting up the RCA in 2012 was to prevent a \"football-like\" situation from developing.\nBut, when asked whether rugby union was heading towards a hire-and-fire approach, Baxter told BBC Spotlight: \"The facts state that it is.\"\nThe 45-year-old, who has been in charge of the club since 2009 when they were in the second tier, said job security for directors of rugby and coaches will \"unfortunately be driven by the professional game, the need to stay in the Premiership or be successful in the Premiership\".\nCockerill was the second director of rugby sacked this season after Andy Robinson at Bristol, with Mike Ford leaving Bath as head coach last term - just 12 months after being named Premiership coach of the year and having only recently been linked with the England job.\nMoon said the timing of recent departures was more damning than the increase in sackings themselves.\n\"There have been more - but ever more interestingly it's when they are happening,\" said Moon. \"They are tending, more recently, to happen during a season rather than at the end of a season.\n\"As an association we are keeping an eye on these developments. More and more, if coaches are not given a reasonable and realistic chance to get to where they want to be in a season, short-termism is of real concern.\"\nCockerill was sacked 12 games into the campaign with Leicester fifth in the table, just five points adrift of Bath in fourth spot, and having led Tigers to semi-finals in both the Premiership and European Champions Cup only last season.\nIn his eight years in charge, Leicester never failed to reach the Premiership play-offs - winning three titles and finishing runners-up twice.\nRobinson, the former England and Scotland head coach, was sacked by Bristol 10 games into the Premiership season, after guiding them back to the top flight following a seven-year absence last May.\n\"There is more short-termism because rugby is big business now,\" added Moon.\n\"There is more expectation on rugby coaches, certainly in the Premiership, to deliver - and if they are not delivering in a short time frame it would seem that owners are being more proactive than they have been in the past.\n\"Coaches seem to be judged on short-term goals and results. Are they judged a bit like football managers in their first two or three games? Or do you get to Christmas, Easter or the Premiership play-offs? That time period is getting smaller and smaller.\"\nSale director of rugby Steve Diamond admits his job is under scrutiny at the AJ Bell Stadium - with Sharks on an eight-match losing run - but he denies the turnover of coaches can be compared to football.\n\"Are we under pressure? Definitely, we need to get some results,\" Diamond told BBC Radio Manchester.\n\"But we know what we are doing and there is no-one better to get us out of the hole we are in than me.\"\nWhen asked if he thought recent sackings were reactionary, Diamond said: \"No, not really. Each club is run differently and every club has different pressures.\"\nTigers, English rugby's most successful club with 10 domestic titles, last won silverware in 2013, beating Northampton Saints in the last of nine straight Premiership final appearances.\nLeicester lock Ed Slater said the recent spate of sackings were \"what you guys want to write about\" when questioned by BBC Radio Leicester on the subject.\n\"Cockers had been here for a long time,\" he said. \"We haven't been to a Premiership final for three years now and at a club like Leicester we are aware of expectations and he ultimately paid the price - we know we want to win silverware and are expected to win silverware.\n\"Four years without something is a long spell.\"\nExeter boss Baxter said the growing popularity of Premiership rugby and increased riches in the game is where the pressure comes from.\n\"The demands of crowds and rugby clubs and the money that is starting to come into the game through TV, a lot of these things are very positive - we work very hard to build our supporter base and a product that people want to buy.\n\"Unfortunately, one of the repercussions of that is that people become more demanding. Sometimes, rightly or wrongly, in pursuit of success - or what is deemed to be success - someone pays the price.\n\"The fact the Premiership is so competitive is something people should cherish and not be too afraid of. That is the balance you would like to think most clubs would come to.\n\"You understand that a season will tilt with one or two injuries or one or two results. Having the strength to see that through is hopefully what we will get back to in rugby and we won't see a cascade of sackings.\n\"Some sackings and some changes of management happen for reasons outside of rugby results and those always happen - but when purely based on results people need a little more understanding.\"\nMoon says he spoke to Richard Bevan, chief executive of football's League Managers' Association (LMA), when forming the RCA and believes rugby coaches face some harsher realities than their football counterparts.\n\"Unlike football, there is not enough professional or semi-professional clubs out there to realistically believe that if you lose your job you will walk into another one at the same level immediately. It is very rare,\" said Moon.\n\"It is important that coaches get the right level of support and backing that their day job deserves.\n\"Richard was incredibly helpful when we identified this idea. They are a juggernaut of an organisation that have been going for a long time and they do invaluable work.\n\"We are some way behind that in the rugby world.\"\nChris Jones, BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter\n\"It is not necessarily a case that suddenly rugby union has adopted a different culture compared to before, but perhaps there are changes as a result of the competitiveness of the Premiership - influenced by the greater central revenues from Rugby Football Union and TV money - coupled with the new private investment at some clubs.\n\"There are probably seven or eight clubs who truly feel they should occupy the top four - or be even better off - in the Premiership.\n\"These clubs include Saracens, Wasps, Exeter, Bath, Leicester, Northampton, Harlequins, Gloucester, while Sale are a club that firmly considers themselves to be a top-six side. In saying that, Bristol, Worcester and Newcastle are all highly ambitious as well.\n\"Wasps and Sale have been boosted by fairly recent private investment, while Gloucester are on the verge of a takeover. Bristol have a billionaire owner too. These are people who all want success, while the traditional powerhouses such as Leicester, Northampton and Harlequins also demand results.\n\"No club is content with its status quo - maybe apart from European and Premiership champions Saracens - and with high expectations from fans and in the boardrooms, comes pressure on coaches - and sackings.\"",

    "document": "Exam regulator Ofqual says there were more than 572,000 queries over grades - an increase of 27%.\nHead teachers have complained about the quality of marking and the damaging impact of incorrect grades.\nOfqual is launching a consultation to overhaul the appeals system.\nThe annual figures from Ofqual show another significant increase in exam papers sent back for being re-marking and grades changed at both A-level and GCSE in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAppeals against results meant that 62,000 grades were changed at GCSE and 28,500 at A-level.\nThe number of grades changed after re-marking has almost doubled in three years. In 99% of cases, it was an upwards change.\nBrian Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said these exam results are of \"critical importance to the future of young people\".\n\"We have warned for some time that the marking system is under huge pressure and fear that the increase in re-grades strongly suggests it is creaking under the strain.\"\n\"Every child sitting an exam deserves to trust that their paper will be marked accurately.  So it is very disappointing to see yet another huge upsurge in false GCSE and A level grades,\" said Chris King, chair of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference group of independent schools.\n\"The implications for pupils are grave - for some it has meant they have wrongly missed out on a place at their preferred sixth form, further education college or university of choice.\"\nBut Mr King said the \"true statistics are likely to be even higher, as we know many state schools do not have the time and resources to put in lengthy, complicated and expensive appeals\".\nThere have been warnings from head teachers' leaders that because of the cost of re-marking, fewer appeals are likely from state schools.\nFigures from the OCR exam board published by the BBC earlier this year showed that independent school exam centres accounted for a disproportionate number of inquiries.\nBut the analysis from Ofqual does not provide an official breakdown of state and independent school challenges to grades - or how much the process costs schools and parents.\nExam boards refund the re-marking fee if an exam is changed - but not if the grade remains the same, with fees costing between about Â£20 and Â£60 per paper.\nThis year's figures show more than 480,000 grades were not changed, representing millions of pounds of expense.\nThe most common result challenged at GCSE was a D grade - reflecting the importance of getting across the C grade threshold. At A-level, the most challenges were for B grades, suggesting it could relate to university applications.\nFigures published on Thursday also showed that 2,460 exam candidates faced penalties for cheating this year, fewer than last year. But penalties for teachers caught cheating, such as giving unfair help to pupils in exams, more than doubled to 262.\nThe Joint Council for Qualifications, representing exam boards, said only a small proportion of exam grades had been found to need changing, in a system with 50,000 markers and 15 million individual scripts.\n\"As data published today by Ofqual shows, each year over 8 million GCSE and A level grades are awarded to a high level of accuracy. Although the number of enquiries about results increased in 2015, the proportion of all grades changed was 1.1%,\" said the JCQ's director general Michael Turner.\nOfqual has launched a consultation into ways of improving the process of querying results.\nIt will address concerns such as a \"lack of transparency in the system\", the time taken to process appeals and the cost to schools and candidates.\nThe proposals include marks only being changed if an examiner has made an error in applying the marking scheme, or adding up the marks.\nThis would mean that if there was a difference in academic judgement between the original marker and a second examiner carrying out a re-mark, the original mark would stand.\nOfqual chief Glenys Stacey said: \"This year we have seen another increase in appeals.\n\"Schools want to do the best for their students, which is understandable given the importance of GCSE, AS and A-level grades on their future prospects, but it also reflects teachers' increasing lack of confidence in marking and the current appeals system.\nWe believe the evidence-based proposals put forward today will improve transparency and fairness.\"",

If Mr Cameron prevails, it concludes, \"Hungarians working in Britain can say goodbye to part of their welfare benefits... but they lose even more if supporters of quitting win\".\nTomasz Bielecki, Brussels correspondent of Poland's liberal Gazeta Wyborcza, agrees that migrant workers like the Poles \"will pay most for Mr Cameron's compromise\", but concludes that \"if it keeps Britain in the EU, it's a price worth paying\".\nA British exit would weaken the European Union, especially in its dealings with Russia, and possibly lead to a \"nightmare domino effect\" with other countries departing, he fears.\nMr Bielecki says the prime minister's best hope is to focus on the overall advantages of the European Union rather than letting his opponents sidetrack the debate into \"marginal issues - including the Brussels deal\".\nOther commentators agree that the referendum has implications far beyond British politics.\nJochen Buchsteiner in Germany's centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung notes that Conservative Brexit campaigners are pitching their appeal on the \"primacy of national sovereignty\".\nThey may well start asking whether Germany will demand concessions from Britain on refugees in return for the Brussels deal, which he says \"owed much\" to Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nHis concern is that a European Union still dominated by immigration, the euro crisis and \"political helplessness\" in June might persuade many voters that EU exit would not be a \"leap in the dark\" but rather a case of \"stepping into the light\".\nLegal analyst Araceli Mangas also has concerns about the referendum, in Spain's conservative El Pais.\nHe writes that Britain remaining in the EU \"matters a great deal\", and a win for Brexit would \"encourage all sorts of populists\".\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug.\nWhen Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody.\nThe following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes.\nWhen they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets.\nThe court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos.\nThe Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast.\nRegarding the drugs seizures in October 2013, Gavin Hughes pleaded guilty to five charges, including possessing cocaine with intent to supply.\nHe was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release.\nHis brother Gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in August and October 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years. Half of this sentence will be spent in jail, with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison.\nJoseph Hughes, who pleaded guilty to a single charge of possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was given a three-year sentence.

    "document": "They range from extra responsibility for off-street parking, through to tourism.\nPotentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions.\nCouncils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas.\nCurrently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department.\nPlanning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service.\nFrom April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions.\nSo is this a positive move, democratising our planning system?\nMichael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic.\nMr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres.\nHe told me the move is \"a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans\".\nBut do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills?\nSpeaking about voters, Mr Corr said: \"They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference.\"\nHowever, not everyone is so upbeat.\nBack in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing.\nProtests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement.\nThe environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent.\nJames Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: \"In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities.\"\nMr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a \"tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here\".\nHe said: \"It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place.\"\nFriends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties.\nSome local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security.\nOthers argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts.\nUnder the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.",

    "document": "Yet while such a prospect would make most of us run a mile, this is in fact a traditional massage method in Russia.\nCalled a \"venik\" massage, the oak bunches are first softened in warm water. And rather than being whacked on your back in anger, they are gently and rhythmically applied.\nIt is a popular treatment in the thousands of steam bathhouses, or \"banyas\", across Russia.\nThe massage, which takes place in a sauna room set at a temperature of 70C, is said to boost circulation and prevent premature ageing of the skin.\nAnd after the treatment has finished you are supposed to immediately jump into a plunge pool of cold water.\nYou might think that such an unusual massage would struggle to be successfully exported from Russia, but the co-founder of the first banya in London says that two years after opening, almost half of its customers are non-Russians.\nLaunching the banya, called Banya No.1, was the dream of entrepreneurial Russian ex-pat Ksenia Bobkova.\nThe 37-year-old has lived in the UK for more than 20 years after moving from St Petersburg to study law at Edinburgh University in 1994.\nAfter graduating from Edinburgh she has had a successful career in finance in London, first working at a large commercial law firm, and then co-founding a new investment company.\nYet as much as Ms Bobkova says she has always enjoyed living in the UK, the one thing she really missed was regular trips to a banya.\nAfter dreaming of opening London's first banya for more than a decade, Ms Bobkova says that in 2012 \"the circumstances came together\" to enable her to finally start work on it.\nFirstly, she realised that more and more Russians were now living in London, which she hoped would make a banya commercially viable, and she had built up enough savings to launch the business.\nThen she found the right building, and two other UK-based Russian investors came on board.\nAfter a year of construction work, including importing a traditional banya stove from Russia, the bathhouse opened its doors in 2013.\n\"When we wrote the business plan, we certainly focused on the fact that the Russian-speaking community in London had grown substantially over the past 15 years,\" she says.\n\"But after we opened we soon discovered that London is so international, and that people who live here are so open to new experiences, that almost half our customers are non-Russian.\"\nCustomers - both male and female - who don't want to strip naked can instead wear their swimming costume, or a strategically placed towel. And for people who wish to avoid the oak leaves, Scandinavian-style, hands-based back massages are also available.\nAfter the massages, people are encouraged to stay and relax in a lounge or rest area, where they can order traditional Russian food.\nWhile Ms Bobkova is reluctant to discuss how financially successful the banya is, it is often full, and typical visits cost Â£100 per person. And she now plans to open more branches.\nRunning the banya is a world apart from Ms Bobkova's main job of helping to lead investment firm Fusion Asset Management, of which she was a founding partner in 2004.\nThe business invests millions of pounds globally on behalf of large institutions, and has a sister office in Moscow.\nWhile the original six founders included one Englishman, an American and a Frenchman, it is now owned and run by three London-based Russian ex-pats.\nMs Bobkova says that she likes working in the UK, because she values what she describes as \"British fair play\" in business.\n\"Without comparing specifically to Russia, what is very fundamental in British business ethics is this concept of fair play,\" she says.\n\"[Doing business in the UK means] you can trust people, and people will generally not try to squeeze you too much. In the UK both sides get a fairly allocated share of the profit, rather than one gets all, and the other gets nothing.\"\nIn terms of her day-to-day style as a boss she says that while she has high expectations of staff, it is a point of principle that the 20 people at the finance firm don't have to work late nights or at weekends.\n\"Nothing in the world is so important that it needs to be done at the weekend,\" she says.\nIn addition to the two businesses, Ms Bobkova is also a co-founder of a networking organisation for Russians living and working in London.\nCalled Russians in the City, and with 2,300 members, it holds quarterly events, such as drinks parties, or polo matches and skiing trips.\nThe world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015?\nA Richer World 2015\nListen to the reports and documentaries\nThe organisation has since opened a sister branch in Switzerland, with other ones due to open in New York and Dubai.\nA UK passport holder, and previously married to a British husband, Ms Bobkova says that Russians in the City allow her to maintain the Russian side of her identity.\n\"I'm British in that I have lived here for 20 years, but I'm also obviously Russian,\" she says.\n\"There are different categories of immigrants. Some are so integrated that they almost deny where they came from, while at the other end, some people don't integrate at all.\n\"I'm somewhere in the middle, I'm fully integrated, I went to a British university... I speak English.... but I also like my Russian heritage, which I nurture through the bathhouse and through the network.\"",

    "document": "\"Rodrigo was nurturing the dream of being a professional footballer. He had been born with a real talent and everyone in his family and his community knew that he was really good at football.\"\nThe teenage boy described by outreach worker Antonio Carlos da Silva could be any of Brazil's football-mad youngsters.\nBut Rodrigo Kelton had not just stood out in training sessions. At only 14, he had already overcome great odds to make it to that age alive.\nRodrigo was one of the thousands of children born into hardship in the north-eastern state of Ceara, where according to official figures more than 133,000 people live on less than 70 reais ($30; Â£18.50) a month.\nBorn into deep poverty and drug addiction, Rodrigo was driven by severe social problems into a perilous existence on the streets of the state capital, Fortaleza.\nBut according to Mr Silva, the outreach worker who first met Rodrigo living on the streets and persuaded him to move into a shelter in 2009, he was on the brink of turning his life around.\n\"He was hoping to turn professional, so that he could help his mother get treatment for her drug addiction and buy her a house,\" Mr Silva recalls.\nPart of what helped him was being part of the Brazilian team competing in the Street Child World Cup, a global tournament that puts the spotlight on issues affecting street children.\nThe tournament currently under way in Rio is the second such event to be held uniting teams of street children from 19 countries, four years after the inaugural competition in Durban.\nBernardo Rosemeyer is the founder of O Pequeno Nazareno, a non-governmental organisation which runs the shelter into which Rodrigo moved aged nine. He says the prospect of competing in the Street Child World Cup instilled discipline in Rodrigo's life.\n\"He had stopped taking drugs and was going to school as part of the conditions to play in the tournament,\" Mr Rosemeyer explains. \"Being in the team was a light in his life. He was even getting on better with his mother who came to all the training sessions.\"\nBut what happened to Team Brazil's best striker shortly before he was due to take part in the Cup reflects the bitter reality of children at the bottom of Brazil's society.\nIn February, Rodrigo decided to move back to the favela, or shanty town, where his family lived.\nHe liked a girl there and dismissed warnings by social workers about the risks of returning to the dangerous neighbourhood.\nAs he left his home on the day of his 14th birthday with his older brother Raphael, the brothers were shot at by members of a drug gang in retaliation for an alleged robbery several years before.\nRodrigo was killed and Raphael only survived because the gun had jammed.\nThe news hit his team mates hard.\n\"I told the players about his death when we all met up to take the bus to the training session,\" recalls Mr Silva.\n\"At first, they did not believe me and thought I was lying. Then they all began to cry and to think about their strategies for survival in the communities where they live.\"\nAt Rodrigo's funeral, it was his team mates who carried his coffin.\nOn the day before their first match, they gathered in a small chapel to remember the teenager who could not make the journey with them from the streets of Fortaleza to Rio to represent their country.\nGoalkeeper Pedro Levi, a 15-year-old who also lived on the streets of Fortaleza before moving into a shelter, says Rodrigo has left a gaping hole in the team: \"He was a great player. The best thing about him was his leadership, he would bring the whole team together.\nPedro says the team is determined to bring the trophy home \"for Rodrigo\".\nBefore their first match against Egypt, the players observed a minute's silence in Rodrigo's honour. Team mate Diego Rocha, 14, held a portrait of Rodrigo as Rio's Archbishop, Dom Orani Tempesta, and a former captain of Brazil's national team, Gilberto Silva, watched.\nRodrigo's team went on to beat Egypt 4-0. But their victory felt bittersweet. \"We dedicate this match to the memory of Rodrigo,\" Diego said.\nThe team is determined that Rodrigo will not be forgotten and plan to keep displaying his portrait as they progress through the tournament to Sunday's final.\nBut the reality for Brazil's 23,000 street children is anything but rosy. Gang and drug violence remain endemic in poor communities.\nIn Rodrigo's home state of Ceara alone, there were 4,462 murders in 2013.\nMurders of street children routinely go unpunished and there has been no investigation into Rodrigo's death.\nTeam mate Vinicius Marcos, 14, knows any of the 300 children believed to live on the streets of Fortaleza could easily run the same fate as Rodrigo.\nSo his hope for his former team mate is a simple one: \"I hope God has him in a good place.\"",

    "document": "The firm predicted that the move would help drive the development of autonomous vehicles.\nCalled Apollo, the project will make a range of software, hardware and data services available to others, especially carmakers.\nOther firms in the sector, such as Tesla and Google, have tended to keep key developments secret.\nBaidu, often described as China's Google, has been developing self-drive vehicles since 2015.\nMaking the announcement ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show, it said technologies for use in restricted test environments would be available as soon July.\nThere will then be a gradual roll-out of other technology, with an aim to offer its full range of developments to support self-driving for highways and city roads by 2020.\nIn a statement, Baidu's group president Qi Lu said it wanted to create a \"collaborative ecosystem\" using its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) to \"encourage greater innovation and opportunities, making better use of our technology to drive the evolution of the entire industry\".\nThis move could be likened to Google's decision to release Android, the free operating system for smartphones, says James Chao of IHS Markit.\nEven though it was free to use, it became a success for Google because it drives users to the company's various mobile apps and services.\nBy becoming the supplier of the \"brains\" for more cars than just the ones it makes itself,  there are clear benefits. One is potential revenue from carmakers in the long term.\nAnd what is also crucial to the development of self-driving vehicles is data. The more cars using its technology, the more data it should be able to harvest.\n\"It really sounds like they want to treat this like a smartphone platform,\" Mr Chao said. \"The holy grail for software in cars is to become the Android or iOS that everyone is using, and this is their strategy to do that.\"\nBaidu's statement alludes to opportunities in the US, but also in its home market.\n\"China is the world's largest market for automotive sales and production. It has many car brands and an open environment that is ripe for collaboration,\" group president Qi Lu said.\nAnalyst Mr Chao agrees. \"I can think of at least 20 Chinese carmakers who would be perfect candidates,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They don't have huge research budgets or the resources to figure out how to make self-driving vehicles themselves.\n\"These are firms that tend to rely on suppliers so they can build a car and so this fits in perfectly for them.\"\nHe said this could mean that Baidu's technology will be used in millions of cars on China's roads by 2020.\nHowever, bigger international carmakers who are already working on autonomous vehicles are unlikely to follow suit.\nMotivated by the widespread pollution problems, Beijing has pushed for more electric vehicles and Chinese carmakers have responded significantly.\nAnd in the race for driverless car technology, Chinese companies are taking big strides. Along with Changan and Geely, Baidu is one of the big players, with AI research being done in both China and Silicon Valley.\nBut it is not clear how the software and hardware Baidu has developed compares with that of its rivals. Some analysts say it has done less testing, and therefore has less data to work with, than Google and Tesla.",

Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he was \"really sorry that I said what I said\", adding it was \"a very stupid thing to do in the presence of all those journalists\".\nThe British biochemist, who was knighted in 2006, said the remarks were \"intended as a light-hearted, ironic comment\" but had been \"interpreted deadly seriously by my audience\".\nHe went on to say he stood by some of the remarks.\n\"I did mean the part about having trouble with girls,\" he said. \"It is true that people - I have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it's very disruptive to the science because it's terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field.\n\"I found that these emotional entanglements made life very difficult.\n\"I'm really, really sorry I caused any offence, that's awful. I certainly didn't mean that. I just meant to be honest, actually.\"\nOn his remarks about women crying, he said: \"It's terribly important that you can criticise people's ideas without criticising them and if they burst into tears, it means that you tend to hold back from getting at the absolute truth.\n\"Science is about nothing but getting at the truth and anything that gets in the way of that diminishes, in my experience, the science.\"\nConnie St Louis, a lecturer in science journalism at City University, was in the 100-strong audience in South Korea.\n\"Nobody was laughing, everybody was stony-faced,\" she told the BBC News Channel.\n\"The Korean female scientists who hosted us looked aghast and he just ploughed on for about five to seven minutes.\n\"It was just really shocking.

    "document": "Scientists have found that two types of chemicals called neonicotinoids and coumaphos are interfering with the insect's ability to learn and remember.\nExperiments revealed that exposure was also lowering brain activity, especially when the two pesticides were used in combination.\nThe research is detailed in two papers in Nature Communications and the Journal of Experimental Biology.\nBut a company that makes the substances said laboratory-based studies did not always apply to bees in the wild.\nAnd another report, published by the Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), concluded that there was no link between bee health and exposure to neonicotinoids.\nThe government agency carried out a study looking at bumblebees living on the edges of fields treated with the chemicals.\nFalling numbers\nHoney bees around the world are facing an uncertain future.\nThey have been hit with a host of diseases, losses of habitat, and in the US the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder has caused numbers to plummet.\nNow researchers are asking whether pesticides are also playing a role in their decline.\nTo investigate, scientists looked at two common pesticides:  neonicotinoids, which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops, and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos, which are used to kill the Varroa mite, a parasite that attacks the honey bee.\nNeonicotinoids are used more commonly in Europe, while coumaphos are more often employed in the United States.\nWork carried out by the University of Dundee, in Scotland, revealed that if the pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators, they caused a loss of brain activity.\nDr Christopher Connolly said: \"We found neonicotinoids cause an immediate hyper-activation - so an epileptic type activity - this was proceeded by neuronal inactivation, where the brain goes quiet and cannot communicate any more.  The same effects occur when we used organophosphates.\n\"And if we used them together, the effect was additive, so they added to the toxicity: the effect was greater when both were present.\"\nAnother series of laboratory-based experiments, carried out at Newcastle University, examined the behaviour of the bees.\nThe researchers there found that bees exposed to both pesticides were unable to learn and then remember floral smells associated with a sweet nectar reward - a skill that is essential for bees in search of food.\nDr Sally Williamson said: \"It would imply that the bees are able to forage less effectively, they are less able to find and learn and remember and then communicate to their hive mates what the good sources of pollen and nectar are.\"\n'No threat'\nShe said that companies that are manufacturing the pesticides should take these findings into account when considering the safety of the chemicals.\nShe explained: \"At the moment, the initial tests for bee toxicity are giving the bees an acute dose and then watching them to see if they die.\n\"But because bees do these complex learning tasks, they are very social animals and they have a complex behavioural repertoire, they don't need to be killed outright in order not to be affected.\"\nThe European Commission recently called for a temporary moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids after a report by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that they posed a high acute risk to pollinators.\nBut 14 out of the 27 EU nations - including the UK and Germany - opposed the ban, and the proposal has now been delayed.\nIan Boyd, chief scientist at Defra, said: \"Decisions on the use of neonicotinoids must be based on sound scientific evidence.\"\nHe said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested - and called for \"further data based on more realistic field trials is required\".\nDr Julian Little, communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited, which makes some of the pesticides, said the findings of laboratory-based studies should not be automatically extrapolated to the field.\n\"If you take an insecticide and you give it directly to an insect, I can guarantee that you will have an effect - I am not at all surprised that this is what you will see,\" he explained.\n\"What is really important is seeing what happens in real situations - in real fields, in real bee colonies, in real bee hives, with real bee keepers.\"",

They're now producing charts showing parts of Australia where sun protection may not be required during some parts of the year.\n\"Some of the messages about sun exposure have been too negative. UK summer sunshine isn't desperately strong. We don't have many days in the year when it is very intense.\n\"What's changed is that we're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.\"\nOfficial government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five.\nBut the experts who wrote the joint statement say mothers often are not made aware of this recommendation. They suggest women consult their GP.\nWinter levels of vitamin D can be helped by a break in the tropical sun - or by eating oily fish, liver and fortified margarine.\nCancer Research UK's chief clinician, Professor Peter Johnson, said: \"A good diet and sensible sun exposure will be adequate for the great majority of the UK population to minimise their cancer risk.\n\"The area of vitamin D and cancer is complex.\n\"There's some evidence, which is strongest in bowel cancer, that low levels of vitamin D in the blood correlate with the risk of developing cancer.\n\"But that doesn't mean those low levels cause bowel cancer.\n\"We think overall that low levels of vitamin D are unlikely to be major contributors to the chances of developing cancer in the UK population.\"\nThe joint statement also highlighted questions about vitamin D that warrant further research.\nThese include finding out the optimal levels of vitamin D, and more detail about the role of dietary sources and supplements.",

They are key players in this. They need to step up to the plate.\"\nThe parties described their two days of talking as business-like, but said there was no sign they were close to resolving the big stumbling block - Sinn Féin's refusal to work with Arlene Foster as first minister while her role in a botched renewable energy scheme is being investigated.\nThe DUP went into last Thursday's election 10 seats ahead of Sinn Féin and, while it remains the largest party with 28 seats, its lead has been cut to just one seat.\nUnder Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, the government must be run by Irish nationalists and unionists together, with the largest party being invited to put forward a candidate for first minister.\nSinn Féin and the DUP now have three weeks to reach a deal and if a government cannot be formed within that time then, under law, another election can be called.\nUltimately, if no power-sharing government is formed, power could return to the UK Parliament at Westminster for the first time in a decade.",

The pair could remain together for about two weeks.\nArktos will eventually return to an enclosure he shares with the other male, Walker.\nRZSS said captive breeding was an important part of a wider effort to conserve polar bears, which are classified as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species.\nHowever, animal welfare organisations OneKind Scotland and Born Free Foundation have said tackling climate change to better protect wild bears should be the focus of conservation efforts rather than captive breeding.\nRZSS, which also manages Edinburgh Zoo where efforts have been made to breed giant pandas, said Arktos and Victoria have mated several times so far.\nThe society said the pair would live together for the next week or two \"mimicking what would occur naturally in the wild\".\nVickie Larkin, head carnivore keeper at the park, said the pair had appeared to have bonded well since being introduced.\nShe said: \"Both polar bears have really warmed to each other and all the signs are really positive.\n\"From the first moment they met, Arktos has been really gentle with Victoria and their bond has been immediate.\n\"Polar bear breeding is inherently complex as the species are induced ovulators, meaning that the female only releases an egg after initial mating occurs.

Brawn said: \"His wife Corinna said that Michael always believed records were there to be broken, and they want to offer their congratulations.\"\nSchumacher has not been seen in public since the skiing accident in 2013 that left him with severe head injuries and in a coma for some months. His family have consistently said his recovery will be long and hard and have given no other news of his condition.\n\"It's a special day,\" said Hamilton. \"I knew it was on the horizon and knew I'd get the 68th pole, but I haven't thought about it much.\n\"But now being there it is an unusual place to be. I remember coming here in 1996, my first grand prix, and watching Michael come by and the engine vibrated my rib cage and that was when my love for the sport took another step.\n\"And I have now equalled him on poles and it is very surreal. It is a humbling experience knowing Michael is such a legend. It is an incredible feat he achieved and I am very proud to be up there with him.\n\"To be able to put a lap together like that is a dream. I have the best job in the world. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\"To hear the message Ross just gave, I have to say a big thank you. I followed Michael and raced against him and always admired him. My prayers are for him and the family and he will always be one of the greatest of all time.\"\nAs good as Hamilton's lap was, Vettel's was equally impressive.\nThe German had been struggling for pace for much of the weekend compared to team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and was half a second down on Hamilton after the first runs in the top-10 shootout.\nWhen Hamilton reduced his own time by a further 0.354secs on his final run and Bottas popped up in second place ahead of Raikkonen, Vettel appeared to have problems.\nBut he produced his own mega-lap to join Hamilton on the front row.\n\"It was the right lap at the right time,\" Vettel said, adding that he had been helped by a slipstream from Raikkonen in the final sector, where the German set the fastest time of all in a part of the track where Mercedes have dominated all weekend.\nThe stage is therefore set for a titanic battle between the two title rivals in the race, which Vettel starts 14 points ahead of Hamilton.\nBehind the Red Bulls, Renault's Nico Hulkenberg was seventh, a place that appeared set to occupied by his team-mate Jolyon Palmer.\nThe Englishman, who has had a difficult start to the season, had the edge on Hulkenberg all day and was seventh in the second part of qualifying.\nBut he suffered a loss of gearbox oil pressure on his out-lap at the start of Q3 and pulled off track in a cloud of smoke.\nPalmer will thus start 10th, as the final Q3 runner, behind the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon.\nMcLaren's Fernando Alonso was 11th, bemoaning a loss of power on his final lap in Q2.\nMcLaren had used team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne, who has a 60-place grid penalty for engine and gearbox transgressions, to 'tow' Alonso to try to compensate for the Honda engines lack of power on both his runs.\nAlonso was 10th after his first run but on his final lap, which looked set to be quicker, the engine lost hybrid energy deployment between Pouhon and Stavelot and he had to abort the lap.\n\"No power, no power,\" he screamed over the radio. But after getting over the frustration he said it was a generally positive weekend because 11th with choice of tyres might be better for the race and that the car had been surprisingly competitive on such a power track.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt was a dire day for Williams, whose drivers Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll both failed to progress beyond the first knockout session.\nMassa ended up 16th and Stroll 18th, the Canadian denied a second attempt to make it into Q2 when Williams ran out of time to change a damaged rear-wing endplate.\nBelgian Grand Prix qualifying results\nBelgian Grand Prix coverage details",

When they come hard at us he goes back hard at them.\n\"Ashwell Prince batted at three last year and it's obviously big boots to fill bit I've really enjoyed it. I've had a few starts so it's good to get a century on the board.\"\nTino Best told BBC Radio Solent:\n\"Mason Crane bowled beautifully. For a 19-year-old leg spinner to have that much control is amazing. England have produced a quality leg spinner. He is really one for the future.\n\"He kept it tight and it gave me the opportunity to really run in and express myself. That's why Hampshire have brought me. At the end of the day, you only have a short while to play this game and I'm 35 this summer. But I'm fit and strong and I'm always ready to go and to commit myself.\n\"The sun was warm, the wicket was flat and I thought to myself that this is just like first-class cricket in Barbados. But you still have to run in hard and bowl quick and that's what Hampshire are paying me to do.\n\"The best wicket for me was getting Steven Croft. He is a good player who can take the game away from you. Alviro Petersen was a prize wicket too. It was a good battle. West Indies versus South Africa. And I'm not going to back down. I knew he was going to play his pulls but I made sure he didn't pull me out of the park because I back myself. That was a big wicket as he is a class act.\"",

I thought it was very funny, I must admit,\" he told the ABC.\n\"What's not funny is the selling off of this country. We hate it and we're tenaciously opposed to it.\"\nQueensland Senator Barry O'Sullivan called the ad \"abhorrent\" and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said it was \"unfortunate\".\nOn the Sunrise breakfast television program, presenter David Koch pressed Mr Katter on why he released the video so soon after a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\nMr Katter responded that there were similar advertisements that did not cause controversy and also claimed not to be aware of the shooting.\nIf this is the best Australia has to offer in the way of political scandal, then we truly are witnessing the world's most boring election campaign.\nMr Katter's ad is typical of Australia's larrikin sense of humour - politically incorrect, jarring and perhaps not quite as funny as it thinks it is.\nBut is it \"abhorrent\" or in \"the worst of taste\"? Should it have been released in the aftermath of the shootings in Orlando?\nAustralia is a long way from Florida and many people in regional centres will share Mr Katter's bawdy sense of humour.\nSometimes humour is rough or tasteless. Sometimes it doesn't hit the bulls eye. But if Katter's constituents don't like his joke, they can toss him out at the election on 2 July.\nBetoota Advocate editor Clancy Overell, who played one of the shot men in the video, said he was aware the video might \"wind people up\" but was not sure Mr Katter had the same understanding.\nMr Overell defended the video's timing, telling the BBC that shootings occurred in the US every day.\n\"Australians can't be prevented from making jokes and about cowboys and western-style gunplay,\" he said.\nA video from the 2012 Queensland state election featured Mr Katter line dancing with a group of young people.\nThe same video depicted him spinning on his head, although it is likely a body double was used for the stunt.",

No injuries were reported.\nThe flight was scheduled to land at 23:23 local time (06:23 GMT) but touched down at 00:11.\nAn investigation into the incident by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is ongoing. The FAA described the near-miss as \"very rare\".\nAir Canada said that 135 passengers and five crew members were on the flight from Toronto.\nIt is not clear how many people were in the four planes on the taxiway.\nThe taxiway, which provides lanes for aircraft to travel between runways and terminals for both landing and takeoff, is distinguished by different coloured lights.\nEarlier, an audio recording was released of what was said to be communication between air traffic controllers and pilots at San Francisco's airport on 7 July.\nIn it, a male voice believed to be that of the Air Canada pilot is heard saying that there are lights on the runway.\nOne of the air traffic controllers replies that there are no other planes there.\nAnother - unidentified - voice is then heard saying: \"Where's this guy going?

    "document": "The Uzbek government announced his death on Friday after a period of rumours about his ill health.\nAs is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process.\nUzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army.\nMr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991.\nDuring his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism.\nBut many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition.\nIt also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy.\nMany Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back.\nSome also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country.\nPositioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history.\nMost recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold.\nIn 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record.\nMoscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West.\nSo far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation.\nPolitical instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders.\nThe country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets.\nTension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.\nRegional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China.\nUzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan.\nUzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts.\nPresident Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power.\nThis, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country.\nShould it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing.\nPresident Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Its fears echo those of anti-globalisation activists, who say Ceta and deals like it give too much power to multinationals - power even to intimidate governments.\nThere have also been big demonstrations in several EU countries against Ceta and the TTIP trade talks with the US.\nThe Canada-EU trade deal was seven years in the making but it took far less time to unravel.\nCanada has been scrambling to keep Ceta together after the Walloon regional assembly in Belgium voted last week to reject it.\nThe deal was completed under Canada's former Conservative government but is a major priority for the Liberals, who are under pressure to boost the country's economy.\nThey dispatched special envoy Pierre Pettigrew, a former cabinet minister with a wealth of experience on the international trade file, to help save the flagging agreement.\nFederal trade minister Chrystia Freeland has met repeatedly over the past months with European leaders to shepherd it through, but with no luck.\nThe failure to clinch the EU-Canada Ceta deal is an embarrassment for the EU. Wallonia, a region of just 3.6 million people, has all but scuppered a trade deal affecting 508 million Europeans and 36.3 million Canadians.\nThe European Commission says this blow does not mean that Ceta is over, but it also refuses to unpick the massive text that was agreed with Canada in 2014.\nAny EU free trade deals with the US, China or India now look remote. Anti-globalisation groups, anxious to protect Europe's welfare and environmental standards, may feel they are winning the argument.\nFor now, any Ceta boost for small businesses and jobs has been postponed. The failure gives us a sense of how tough the Brexit talks will be, despite the UK's current alignment with its EU partners.\nOne very obvious lesson from this impasse is that it is going to be difficult for the European Union to implement trade and investment deals, perhaps with anyone.\nFor the UK post-Brexit it suggests two contrasting implications. Negotiating a trade agreement that gives British exporters barrier free access to the EU's single market could be a huge challenge.\nFor sure, there will be some important differences. For the EU, Britain is a more important export market than Canada, so some EU states will have a good deal to lose from failing to agree.

The locals call it \"camanchaca\".\nThe fog is made up of minuscule drops of water which are so light they do not fall as rain.\nDuring a particularly severe drought in 1956, scientist Carlos Espinosa Arancibia had an idea.\nThe retired maths and physics professor from the University of Chile carried out a series of experiments in the highest hills near the city of Antofagasta.\nThere, he came up with the idea of the fog catcher: netting with tiny openings of approximately 1mm across to capture the tiny water droplets in the fog.\nThe droplets accumulate in the netting and form a bigger drop which eventually runs off the netting into a canal underneath.\nFrom there, it is channelled through a pipe to containers at the base of the hills, ready for use.\nAnd the research continues today.\nThe town of Pena Blanca boasts one of the biggest study centres for the fog catchers. There are six big nets in the hills overlooking the town.\nTechnical adviser Nicolas Schneider says that thanks to the fog catcher they have managed to combat the desertification of the region.\nHe says that 100 hectares now are again covered in the flora once typical for the region.\n\"We're planning to provide local families with water from the fog catcher in the near future,\" Mr Schneider says.\nAt the heart of the community is a small building which also uses water from the fog catcher: the town's small artisanal brewery.\nFog Catcher Brewery is small. It only produces has three vats and one cold store producing about 24,000 litres per year, but it is the pride and joy of its owner, Miguel Carcuro.\n\"The water from the camanchaca is of excellent quality and gives our beer a special quality,\" he says.\nThe project's backers say the fog catchers are cheap and sustainable.\nAn average-sized fog catcher of 40sq m costs between $1,000 (£635) and $1,500 depending on the material used.\nThey say its impact on the environment is minimal as the metal posts can be discreetly hidden among vegetation.\nAs the water is transported down the hill by gravity, there is no extra cost involved for transport, they say.\nIt is an idea which has been exported to other arid regions in Peru and Mexico.\nThe largest expanse of fog catchers is located in Tojquia in Guatemala, where 60 fog catchers trap 4,000 litres of water a day.\nProf Pilar Cereceda of the University of Chile says she hopes that within a decade Chile will have enough fog catchers to supply the whole Atacama region.\n\"I dream of the day in which the fog catchers can compete with desalination plants, which is not environmentally friendly.\"",

    "document": "As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin?\nThen I realised that one man was staring intensely at a very chunky laptop - this was Dr Craig Wright. He carried on working, apparently unaware that we had entered the room.\nOnce we had been introduced he gradually warmed up - especially when it came to performing the demonstration that showed that he did have access to the cryptographic keys used by Satoshi when he made the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009.\nWe had arrived wondering just how convincing a case would be made that the almost mythical creator of Bitcoin was at last stepping out of the shadows. What we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain.\nBut Jon Matonis, a senior figure in the Bitcoin world, was in the room watching, having had his own demonstration some time before. And the news that Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, was also convinced provided more reassurance. Now Craig Wright has published his evidence on his blog, it will be examined in minute detail for any chink in his case.\nBut put aside the question of whether you believe him or not - and he told me he didn't care either way - there were still plenty of questions we wanted to put to the fascinating, if somewhat prickly Dr Wright. Why keep his secret so long? Why come out now? What about that run-in with the Australian tax authorities? And is he fabulously rich, with a huge stock of Bitcoin?\nAt our first meeting - without a television camera  - we roamed freely over all sorts of territory. We learned that he ran a substantial business in London, employing quite a few people here in what seemed to be some kind of Bitcoin trading and consultancy operation.\nWe challenged him about that tax investigation - he conceded that there was what he called an \"audit\" underway in Australia but insisted that this was mainly due to the tax authorities there not really understanding Bitcoin.  We asked where the pseudonym had come from - he mentioned a 17th century libertarian philosopher called Nakamoto but said he'd keep the Satoshi bit to himself.\nHe talked of the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose statement refusing the Nobel Prize is used in the Satoshi-signed file given as evidence in the blog published today. His politics were very far from the \"lefty\" Sartre, he explained, but like him he did not want his identity to be defined by one thing - he refused to be Craig \"Satoshi\"  just as Sartre did not want to be Jean-Paul Nobel.\nWhat he wouldn't say is how many Bitcoins he has - \"that would be telling\" - though he indicated that he would not be spending any of them in a hurry. He told us that he had a \"nice big house and a nice fast car\" in London, went on holidays to Paris, and didn't feel the need to acquire vast riches.\nThe second time we met, to film a television interview, the mood changed. It was immediately clear that he hated the whole process, refusing to move from behind his laptop to a more spacious room where the shot would have been much better.\nAt first, he insisted that he would give an answer to just one question - why he had decided to go public after all these years. Once we started filming he opened up a little, but mainly because he wanted to express his anger at, as he sees it, being forced into the public eye.\n\"I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want adoration, I just want to be left alone,\" he said with some venom. He accused journalists of threatening to make up stories about him if he did not cooperate and said lies had been told that would affect his family and his staff.\nIt seems his main grievance surrounds the stories that spread last December when he was first identified as a potential Satoshi, then dismissed by some as a hoaxer. At that time, questions were asked about his academic and business career, and there were some who said he just did not have the intellectual capacity to be the man behind Bitcoin.\nThroughout the demonstrations he showed us he kept on stressing the complexity of the process - \"obviously everyone said I have no idea about this stuff so I'm going to do it in the most convoluted way possible\". We were then supplied with a series of documents providing evidence that Dr Craig Stephen Wright was a Master of Statistics, IT Management, and Law, and a long list of peer-reviewed articles.\nNow he says he intends to continue his research into improving the technology behind Bitcoin, and plans to publish several papers over the coming months. With the community around the currency in some turmoil right now over how it develops, you might think that Craig Wright could provide some leadership.\nAfter all, he could be said to be to Bitcoin what Tim Berners-Lee is to the web.\nBut he bridled at my suggestion that he could be a figurehead for the currency, making clear that this was the first and last television interview he would do. Having emerged from the shadows, Craig Satoshi Wright now wants to return to them as quickly as possible.",

It has been the cornerstone of corporate governance ever since.\nIt recommended an independent board, reasonable pay to attract executives and formal processes to appoint directors.\n\"The Financial Reporting Council which controls the Cadbury code, and is a rather timid body, should get stronger,\" Lord Myners told the BBC's Today programme.\nIt should \"stand up to government and say we need legal change in a number of areas to strengthen governance\".\nThe code has no punitive means of enforcement and follows a so-called comply or explain model. If a company wishes to shun a particular rule, it can give its reasons for doing so.\nThis arrangement aims to stop companies ducking rules as a matter course and rewards openness. But critics say it treats all rules as optional.\n\"It hasn't been binding enough,\" Lord Myners said.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the FRC said: \"The FRC has called on the government for more powers to tackle all directors when companies fail, not just those we regulate (accountants and actuaries), and we want more scrutiny on directors fulfilling their obligations under the Companies Act.\n\"The Corporate Governance Code's 'comply or explain' approach has allowed the FRC to respond confidently and effectively to evolving market circumstances, which prescriptive hard rules often cannot.\"\nIts latest monitoring report on the code shows \"high compliance\" among companies, but when boards don't follow the rules \"too many explanations are of poor quality\".\n\"This suggests that some boards still need to do more than pay lip service to the needs of their shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\"The FRC believes more focused reporting by boards on how they discharge their responsibilities is necessary and has called for more oversight powers from government to help achieve this.\"\nAnother criticism from Lord Myners is the role of shareholders themselves in controlling corporations.\n\"Cadbury did not focus at all on the roles and the duties and obligation of the shareholders and that's where the failing is happening,\" he said.\n\"Nobody owns enough of a company to really be put out enough to really dig in and find out what's wrong.\" He termed this the problem of \"ownerless corporations.\"\nThis view echoed that of Chris Philp, MP for Croydon South, who told the Today programme in September that UK companies should adopt a Swedish-style shareholder committee in an effort to curb excessive pay for bosses.\nThe five biggest shareholders in large publicly-traded companies would sit on the committee, Mr Philp suggested, and this would make decisions on pay and hiring directors.\nHis plan follows a call from Prime Minister Theresa May for tighter controls on corporate excess.",

We have had a couple of nights when we have gone back to the hotel and we've had a drink.\n\"And a couple of times we have spoken with [captain] Sam [Warburton] and the senior players about putting the curfew on when the players come back after going out.\n\"You can't keep a lid on everything. You play a night game and there's a lot adrenalin and you say to players 'look go out if you are back in the hotel by 1.30 in the morning'. They might have gone to the casino [but] they are not drinking alcohol - some of them might have had a beer.\n\"There is a lot made that we are whiter than white. We definitely are not.\"\nBut Gatland admitted he has been impressed with the attitude of his players both on and off the field.\n\"These guys have been great ambassadors in this campaign for Wales,\" said the coach, whose side set up a meeting with France by beating Ireland in the quarter-finals.\n\"That's what's been important. There has been a sea-shift in terms of the professionalism and the way we have prepared.\n\"These guys have known right from day one that we were in pretty good shape heading towards this World Cup and if we looked after ourselves, both on and off the field, we could made an impact. I think we have done that.\"\nGatland was quick to point out that he has taken little pleasure from England's controversial World Cup, which was haunted by a string of off-the-field controversies.\nThe conduct of some England players resulted in front-page headlines throughout the tournament, prompting the Rugby Football Union to launch a review of player behaviour following the country's quarter-final exit at the hands of France.\nOn one occasion, captain Mike Tindall found his conduct under scrutiny after a group of players were given permission by team manager Martin Johnson to enjoy a night out drinking in Queenstown.\nAs a coach I don't take any satisfaction whatsoever or any pleasure in the criticism that has been heaped on England\nTindall, who married the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips in July, later issued an apology for misleading the England management over his movements, having initially claimed he did not go on to another bar afterwards.\nThere were other indiscretions, too, notably when centre Manu Tuilagi was formally warned by police and fined £3,000 by England rugby officials after jumping from a ferry in Auckland.\n\"As a coach, I don't take any satisfaction whatsoever or any pleasure in the criticism that has been heaped on England,\" insisted Gatland.\n\"I know what it's like to be on the wrong side of the media in the past. As a fellow coach, there are a lot of good friends of mine in the England set-up.\n\"I don't take any pleasure - and I'm sure the Welsh team don't take any pleasure - on all that criticism that has been heaped on England.\n\"So, I just want to say we are no monks, we are not whiter than white and we have had our problems in the past.\"",

    "document": "A lot has changed since All Saints first charged onto the scene in 1997. Back then, Tony Blair had just won the election, Oasis were at number one with Be Here Now, and the world's biggest website was a page full of dancing hamsters.\nPop music was in the doldrums - this was the year of Barbie Girl and Gary Barlow's solo album - so Shaznay Lewis, Melanie Blatt and sisters Natalie and Nicole Appleton were a welcome breath of fresh air.\nPositioned as a credible alternative to the Spice Girls, they wrote their own material, dressed in street-smart clothes and shunned the chirpy choreography of other girl groups (their signature move was an apathetic shrug of the shoulders).\nBut it was a difficult time to be a woman in the male-dominated music industry.\nFemale pop stars were expected to dress provocatively - a revealing photoshoot for FHM was a rite of passage - and All Saints, never knowingly in possession of a smile, were frequently dismissed as \"difficult\" or \"sulky\".\nIt was unfair and it was sexist, protests Melanie.\n\"A lot of Britpop groups at the time would act very arrogantly and very stroppy, but that was never seen as a negative thing,\" she says.\n\"We weren't half as bad - but if we didn't want to smile one day, or we weren't really interested in doing an interview, we'd be labelled as stroppy cows.\"\nThe sexism spilled over into their TV appearances, and the band shudder as they recall a traumatic Top of the Pops taping.\n\"They were filming images of us to use as a backdrop,\" says Shaznay, \"and they wanted us to take our tops off.\"\nThe producers, they explain, wanted to shoot the band from the shoulders up, giving the impression they were performing in the nude.\n\"The vision was that we looked naked and we didn't want that vision,\" adds Natalie. \"But because it was such a huge show, we were told 'if you don't do it, you don't get to go on the show,'\" says Melanie.\n\"The girl that worked with us was in tears because she was trying to fight our corner,\" Natalie continues. \"We ended up having to compromise with the producers. We dropped our tops to here [indicating her armpits] so it would look like we were topless.\"\n\"We did it but we were stroppy about it,\" says Nicole. \"Again, we got labelled as being difficult.\"\nA BBC spokesman said: \"We're not able to comment on something that is alleged to have happened nearly 20 years ago, but today we seek to ensure that everyone working at the BBC does so in an environment in which they are comfortable.\"\nNineteen years later, squeezed together on a couch in West London, the band are anything but stroppy. They trip over each other's words, trading jokes and locking their band-mates out of hotel rooms as a way of surviving a long day of press interviews. Even the Top of the Pops incident is laughed off.\n\"These days it'd be like, 'you want to see me naked? OK! Sure!\" jokes Natalie. \"I'll take my trousers off this time!\"\nTheir camaraderie is something of a surprise. After two multi-platinum albums, the band imploded in 2001 over the disputed ownership of a combat jacket.\n\"Being in a group is like being in a marriage, and right now we are going through a really rough time,\" Nicole said shortly before the split. A subsequent statement confirmed the band were \"on ice\" in order to \"clear the air between themselves\".\nThe former schoolfriends didn't speak for years, but bridges were built during a brief reunion in 2006, and strengthened on a nostalgia tour with the Backstreet Boys three years ago.\n\"But we still get asked about the jacket every day,\" laughs Nicole.\nFollowing the 2013 tour, the band were keen to continue, but their management suggested they needed new material before going back on the road.\n\"Shaz was nominated to write the album,\" says Natalie, \"but there was no master plan, no-one telling us, 'this is the vision we have for you'. There was no pressure. And she pulled out an amazing record.\"\nAfter a year in the studio, All Saints' comeback was announced on New Year's Day via Twitter but the response was more one of curiosity than enthusiasm until the band unveiled their new single on Chris Evans's Radio 2 Breakfast show.\nOne Strike recalls the dreamy, blissed-out sound of their number one hit Pure Shores, with the quartet's silken harmonies provoking a rush of 90s nostalgia.\n\"It was a natural first single,\" says Shaznay. \"We didn't really even have to discuss it that much. It was the first song we recorded together again. It's just a great beginning.\"\nAlthough written by Shaznay, the lyrics were triggered by Nicole's divorce from Liam Gallagher. The couple split in 2013 after the Oasis star phoned his wife on holiday and confessed to fathering a child with another woman. One Strike refers to that phone call, and \"how your life can change in an instant\".\n\"Like everybody's seen and heard [in the press], I was away when stuff went down,\" says Nicole. \"I had to pull myself together because I'd got my family and kids around me but, after a couple of days of letting it sink in, I was on the phone with Shaz for a long time, just explaining [how] I was getting through it. You know, having to stand up to it, instead of becoming some sort of victim.\n\"The next thing I knewâ€¦ she played [One Strike] to me and I was singing along. Then she said, 'were you listening to what the song's about?' and suddenly the penny dropped and I was like, 'oh my God. It's our phone call!'\n\"The thing is, for me, I've kind of handled everything with dignity and the support of the girls and my family. I think the song represents that very well. I don't feel sad when I hear it, I feel quite liberated. It's a very positive song. It's just great. It really captured the moment.\"\nAs Nicole tells this story, Shaznay quietly watches her with the protective gaze of a mother. At 40, she is the band's youngest member - but the others look up to her as the leader; the one they turn to for advice and, says Nicole, \"a great listener\".\n\"She writes poetry,\" says Natalie. \"Sometimes, when I start to think about the things she's written, it blows my mind.\"\nIn the 10-year gap between albums, Shaznay has continued to work as a songwriter, collaborating with the likes of Little Mix and Sugababes  - so how did she relocate the trademark All Saints sound?\n\"I actually can't explain it,\" she says. \"I think one of the fundamental ingredients for the sound is our voices together and that sort of slotted back into place.\"\nHowever, she says, everyone's voice changed in the intervening years, meaning the arrangements have to be re-written for their upcoming tour.\n\"I used to do the high harmony, now I do the low one,\" explains Melanie. \"My balls have dropped.\"\nNot for the first time, the band cackle with laughter, happily unencumbered by the media training that dictates most modern interviews.\n\"Artists tend to be more careful of what they say now, because it can move into the stratosphere so quickly,\" says Shaznay. \"But while it's understandable, I think it's a shame - because you lose the essence of who an artist is. You don't get a real feel for anybody, so everybody becomes generic.\"\nPerhaps that's the essence of All Saints' appeal - they're not caricatures, but real women who embrace their strengths and flaws.\nSo, is this reunion the start of a new chapter?\n\"When we'd finished this album we could have easily carried on because, by the time we got to the end, we'd started to explore different sounds,\" says Shaznay. \"I think if we hear more material that we're inspired by, we'll definitely write more.\"\n\"But we're in no rush,\" cautions Melanie. \"We're taking our time.\"\nSurely they won't wait another 10 years, though?\n\"It'll take me that long,\" says Nicole, \"to get off this couch.\"\nAll Saints' album Red Flag is out now on London Records.",

He says his favourite luxury brands are now substantially cheaper in London.\n\"Like anything from Comme Des Garcons. I got a jacket last time I was there for 40% less than I would have paid here,\" he says.\nBefore June last year, when the UK voted to leave the EU, he rarely went shopping on his regular work trips to the UK.\n\"The littlest things from a pint at the pub to a short Uber ride were murder on my bank account because of the exchange rate.\"\nNow that some brands are significantly cheaper, he spends about $350 (£274; 310 euros) each time he comes, but thinks the favourable exchange rate means he saves around $100.\n\"It's easier for me to splurge and sometimes I do it too much for my own good,\" he confesses.\nMr DeLeon isn't the only one indulging.\nJust over a year on from the EU referendum, the pound is still around 16% lower against the dollar.\nThe weakness has lured over a flock of international tourists hungry for high-end brands at relatively bargain prices.\nPayments firm WorldPay says non-UK consumers' card spending at department stores rose by a fifth in the first three months of the year, while spending on electrical goods rose 22.7%.\nUS shoppers like Mr DeLeon have been amongst the biggest spenders, splashing out an extra 21.5% on their cards during the same period, it said.\n\"The extreme currency fluctuations encourages shoppers to buy more,\" says Honor Strachan, principal retail analyst at GlobalData.\n\"They're getting more for their money.\"\nBut how do companies manage this kind of discrepancy; with precisely the same product priced significantly differently depending on where in the world it is bought?\nAfter all a boom in revenues in one market, can seriously dent demand in the markets international shoppers are coming from.\nMany of the world's most famous brands — such as Burberry and Apple — simply raised their UK prices to try and make sure what they sold cost broadly the same across their international markets.\nBut luxury footwear brand Crockett & Jones, which has 12 stores worldwide across locations including London, Paris and New York as well as global wholesale partners, says it has deliberately left prices unchanged.\n\"The last thing we want to do is abuse our customer confidence and raise prices in the UK.\n\"We certainly don't increase our prices at a whim to take advantage of said currency fluctuations,\" says James Fox, export sales director at the firm.\nMr Fox believes that in the long term it's best to keep pricing simple.\n\"We strive to have a level playing field as and where we can.\n\"We offer sterling, euro and dollar price lists, which gives our customers piece of mind that they are buying in their own currency at a level price to the potential competitors within their market.\"\nHe says generally any discrepancies tend to average out across currencies, and that re-pricing is only possible \"once or twice a year\" due to the upheaval it causes for the business overall.\nSo is he concerned that the firm could be losing out financially?\n\"We are fortunate to be in a position that we have a few very strong 'Brexit proof' markets which underpin the company when the UK is trying its best to screw up international trade,\" says Mr Fox.\nBy selling both through its own stores and through wholesalers the firm's risk is already spread out, he adds.\nCrockett & Jones is not the only retailer which has kept prices steady.\nRay Clacher, executive vice-president at Trinity - owner of premium brands Gieves & Hawkes, Kent & Curwen and Cerruti 1881 - says non-EU tourists using either the US dollar or a currency that trades in line with the dollar, have driven up sales at its London stores.\nNonetheless, these sales are still just a small percentage of Trinity's total revenue.\n\"We certainly have not adjusted our retail prices to reflect the influx of tourism, in fact, quite the opposite as we want to encourage more UK [sales],\" he says.\nHowever, he admits this strategy could change if costs continue to rise.\n\"If inflation continues to rise and sterling continues to struggle against the euro and dollar, we will have no choice but to pass on the cost to our customers - but not at present,\" says Mr Clacher.\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\nThe apples that need shading from the sun\nHow the 'better burger' is taking over the world\nWhat it takes to get Beyonce on a world tour\nThe country losing out in the breakfast juice battle\nWhy a $1.6bn car plant has been left to decay\nRead more global trade series here.\nBut it is also important not to be too greedy. Many US retailers that have come to the UK have simply swapped their dollar signs on their US price tags for pounds - betting that British consumers will be willing to pay a premium for their goods.\nBanana Republic is one such example. After eight years in the UK, it announced last year it would close all eight of its stores. The decision followed six consecutive quarters of falling sales.\n\"They thought that because they were a big brand, they could demand higher prices.\nBut UK consumers \"are savvier than that,\" says Ms Strachan.\nYet for retailers doing a straight currency conversion from their local currency to the country where they are selling their goods also doesn't necessarily work.\n\"Asos made a big thing about launching local websites with a straight currency conversion and it didn't work - local pricing didn't fit in line with competitors.\n\"Brands need to look at who else is operating in that space, the wealth of consumers there, and what they're willing to pay, and then price accordingly using localised pricing structures,\" says Ms Strachan.\nMany firms, particularly larger brands such as Hermes also use currency hedging to protect themselves. This involves working with a bank to buy currency at the current rate to protect themselves against adverse future volatility.\nIn the end, though Ms Strachan says a company's ability to cope with currency volatility comes down to how much people want to buy what they sell.\n\"If they still want it customers will buy it,\" she says.",

We only excavated 1sq m of the 'bone bed' and we got more than 200 bones.\"\nThe researchers studied the fossils using a variety of techniques, including histology and infrared spectroscopy with a synchrotron in Taiwan.\n\"The neat thing is that we can get these materials in our hands, we can handle them, cut them, we can look inside the bones - and what we found out is they are growing quite fast, faster than other dinosaurs and faster than a lot of living animals whose embryology we know very well.\"\nWhile the researchers cannot establish how long the incubation period was, this finding does suggest that it was short. The team believes the animals emerged well developed and might have continued to develop quickly.\nProfessor Reisz said: \"We are hypothesising if this very fast growth rate we see in the embryos was maintained in the hatchlings and the juveniles, then we have a very fast growth rate in the initial stages of the life of this animal.\"\nThe Lufengosaurus belongs to a group of dinosaurs called the sauropodomorphs, and is a predecessor of the sauropod, a true giant of the dinosaur world that could grow up to 60m (200ft) in length.\nYou can hear more about this research on the BBC World Service programme Science in Action; a schedule of broadcasts can be found here.

The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.\nIn addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.\nAlthough several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.\nThey can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.\nBut Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.\n\"What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar,\" said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\nThe new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.",

She said, 'stay here as long as you like, take deep breaths, be present'.\n\"It was perfect, really.\"\nEntry to the exhibition, which lasts for 10 weeks, is free but only 160 people can be admitted at a time. Each can stay as long as they wish, with the gallery imposing a \"one in - one out\" policy.\nAbramovic herself opened the gallery doors at 10:00 BST - as she will every day - by which point there were already hundreds of acolytes and art lovers queuing in Kensington Gardens.\nGeraldine, an art professor from Kensington, had arrived at 06:30 BST to be amongst the first to see the performance.\n\"It was like being at a very beautiful party where nobody talks,\" she told the BBC. \"It may push me into doing some meditation, which is probably very good for me, so it changed my life in a very positive way.\"\n\"Just to sit and get lost in one's thoughts, I think it's very relaxing,\" said Andrew, a psychiatrist visiting the UK from San Francisco.\n\"And certainly some people were crying, too, so perhaps it brings up some thoughts that one pushes down from normal life.\"\nThe show is titled 512 Hours, after the amount of time Abramovic will spend in the gallery.\nIt is her first performance work since The Artist is Present, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she sat motionless, six days a week, looking directly at whoever sat down in a chair placed opposite her.\nBoth shows lack the startling drama of her earlier performances, including one in which she systematically stabbed her hand with knives.\nIn another, she whipped herself, before cutting a five-point star in her stomach with a razor blade and lying on a cross made of ice.\nOnce, she nearly died after lying in the middle of a burning cross made of petrol-soaked sawdust. On another occasion, she allowed an audience member to hold a loaded gun to her head.\nNonetheless, she told the BBC her latest show \"really frightens me\".\n\"I worry about the British public,\" she said, adding that the public's cynicism might get in the way of creating \"a pure emotional connection\".\n\"My only chance with the British public is to be vulnerable,\" she told Radio 4's Front Row. \"The audience is someone who completes the work.\"\nAhead of the show, the 67-year-old was accused of failing to acknowledge other artists who engage in the \"art of nothing\".\nTwo weeks ago, a  group of US art historians curators wrote to the Serpentine, asking it to recognise the influence of Mary Ellen Carroll. a conceptual artist who has been working on a project called \"Nothing\" since 2006, when she went to Argentina with only her passport.\nBut Abramovic dismissed the accusations, telling the BBC: \"There is nothing on the walls of the gallery, no work. But I am working eight hours a day with the energy of the public.\"\nDuring the first hour of the first day of her performance, Abramovic seemed to be playing a giant game of cosmic yogic chess, with the public as her pieces, positioned carefully throughout the gallery.\nThere was something eerie about entering a room full of bodies frozen in space but, once guided into position, most of the visitors reported feeling an overwhelming sense of wellbeing.\n\"I started seeing the sky - the clouds in the sky - in the white of the wall,\" said Chester, a TV producer who had skipped work to attend the opening.\n\"It was a religious experience. I think you'd have to sum it up as that.\"\nAbramovic says the performance will evolve over the course of its 10-week run.\n\"Maybe it's complete silence, maybe we all scream together, maybe we all lie on the floor.\n\"Everything is there, in possibility.

Tragically, that proved to be a lethal combination.\n\"Collins also failed to ensure Joseph was seated securely in the vehicle - again a huge error in judgement that he will now have to live with for the rest of his life.\"\nSpeaking after the hearing, Joseph's father, Tom Smith, said of the crash: \"It's traumatised me, I don't sleep, all I do is think about that little boy.\"\nAnn Haile of the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"This case is a stark reminder of how dangerous moving vehicles are when they are not controlled properly, and how important it is for children to be in a suitable, properly fitted car seat.\"",

We were walking through the woods, stepping over logs, looking up at the beautiful trees.\n\"And when I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable.\n\"It’s one thing to see images of an experience you had, but it’s another thing to have an experience of the experience. It was the closest I’d ever come to feeling like I was there again.\"\nOn Saturday, Snap released some limited information about how the glasses will work.\nFootage will be recorded in a new, circular format which can be viewed in any orientation, the company said. The battery on the device will last about a day.\nA light on the front of the device will indicate to people nearby when the glasses are recording.\nPrior to confirmation from Snap about the product, news website Business Insider published a promotional video it found on YouTube showing the product. The video has since been taken down.\nBroken Glass\nSpectacles will remind many of Google Glass, an ill-fated attempt by the search giant to create smart glasses.\nWhile Google Glass did get into the hands of developers around the world - at a cost of $1,500 each - the device never came close to being a consumer product. The company eventually halted development, but insisted the idea was not dead.\nThough Glass was beset by hardware issues, perhaps its main flaw was the public perception. At worst, many saw it as troubling, privacy-invading technology. At best, others just considered it ridiculous-looking.\nHowever, with a far lower price point, and likely adoption by influential celebrities, Snap’s Spectacles stand a solid chance of being seen as cooler than Google’s attempt.\n\"If you look at the kinds of glasses millennials wear, the design is very ‘in’,\" suggested Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst from Creative Strategies.\n\"Making them sunglasses helps hide the camera better, but it also limits the usage somewhat - you’ll need to be outside in daylight.\nShe added: \"The name change is interesting as it would indicate a change in focus away from messaging, which with Spectacles makes sense. Snap is perhaps becoming more about life-logging, content generation and story-telling.\"\nAccording to the WSJ, Snap is not treating the device as a major hardware launch, rather a fun toy that will have limited distribution.\n\"We’re going to take a slow approach to rolling them out,” Mr Spiegel told the newspaper.\n“It’s about us figuring out if it fits into people’s lives and seeing how they like it.\"\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook",

Buhari has himself to blame for unfortunately being a gentleman!\"\nOver in The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh is no gentleman - he's chosen to squat at State House.\nHe lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow and publicly conceded defeat.\nA little later, the thought of leaving the seat he has called his own for the last 22 years overpowered him and he changed his mind.\nAfrica and the world have asked him to go home, but he is defiant.\nAs his last day in office approaches on 19 of January, the same force he used to gain power in 1994 could be used to relieve him of his office.\nThere are three notable people who will be bowing out of office in 2017.\nEllen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa, is coming to the end of her second and final term of office in Liberia.\nOne of those waiting on the touchline to join the succession race is football star George Weah.\nThe former AC Milan and Chelsea striker failed to score in the 2005 presidential tournament but hopes 2017 will be his year.\nAngolans will have a chance to replace the only man they've known as president for nearly 40 years.\nAlthough Jose Eduardo dos Santos has announced he'll step down, his blood will still flow through the veins of power and the economy in Angola.\nHis daughter, Isabel, heads Sonangol, the state oil company and is considered by Forbes to be Africa's richest woman, while his son, Jose, is chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, Fundo Soberano de Angola.\nIn neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, 2017 could mark the beginning of the end for another family dynasty, which started in 1997 when Laurent Desire Kabila became president after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko.\nLaurent Kabila's son Joseph picked up the reigns after his father's assassination in 2001, and was bent on staying in power until attempts to change the constitution to allow him a third term backfired.\nViolent street protests have piled pressure on President Kabila to exit from office this year and the issue is bound to continue into the new year.\nThe theme of falling is alive in South Africa.\nThe #FeesMustFall campaign by university students sought to fight the rising cost of higher education and saw violent clashes between police and protesters, disruptions in the university calendar and the arrest of a number of students.\n2017 promises more of the same because not only have the fees not fallen, some top universities have announced an 8% increase.\nAnd then there's the question of the country's President Jacob Zuma.\nIn December 2017, his tenure as leader of the governing ANC party runs out, but his term as the country's president only ends in 2019.\nAllowing Mr Zuma to continue as head of state but with the ANC under someone else's leadership could create two centres of power, which could be political suicide.\nSo will the ANC #LetZumaFall as it did President Thabo Mbeki under similar circumstances?\n2017 will have answers.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) is another that could face the threat of falling in Africa if more African countries continue to withdraw from the Rome Statute.\nA number of countries have notified the UN Secretary-General of their intention to withdraw, saying the ICC unfairly targets African leaders in its application of international justice.\nAnd now to international trends where fashion, like history, has a habit of repeating itself.\nA quick glance at catwalk signs for 2017 shows that the hems of women's skirts will be falling - to just below the knee.\nApparently midi-skirts elongate the figure and flatter the wearer, so this must be a good fall.\nThe Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicks off in mid-January in Gabon and Uganda carries the hopes of East Africa.\nThe region has a terrible record in continental football.\nUganda's last appearance in the finals was in 1978 when it lost to Ghana in the final.\nKenya and Tanzania have never progressed beyond the group stage, so if Uganda can rise, East Africa can stand tall.\nIn politics, despite all manner of socio-economic challenges, the spirit of the Africans is on the rise - they've already just about removed one long-serving president from power (The Gambia, even if he is still resisting ) and in 2017 a couple more might follow (DR Congo, Angola)\nWhen Africa stumbles, it must rise because as they say in Nigeria, the sun shines on those who stand before it shines on those who are sitting.\nMore from Joseph Warungu:\nShould the UK join the African Union?\nKenyans beg for mercy\nDoctors take on traditional healers\nWhy Kenya has banned on-air sex",

    "document": "But the music in the air is understated these days. Birdsong and the chatter of children have replaced the loud clang and clatter of heavy industry.\nIt is not the hush of contentment, but the quiet of an industrial graveyard.\nA council leader warns of history repeating itself. A local activist urges the people of Wales to show heart and spirit and fight back.\nThe message to Port Talbot from Ravenscraig is blunt: don't let this happen to you.\nRavenscraig steelworks in central Scotland closed in 1992 after a bitter 12-year fight.\nThere is still a numbness here, the pain of a phantom limb still nearly unbearable almost a quarter of a century after amputation.\nThe questions it raises - about the UK's industrial strategy and the way areas are treated when their main source of employment disappears - are still raw.\nListen to Mark Mardell's full report from Ravenscraig on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.\nWorkers were given generous compensation and retrained, according to one union leader, but the promised regeneration never came.\nThe 'Craig, as everyone around here calls it with familiar affection, covered an area twice the size of Monaco. Today it is largely a wasteland, the biggest brownfield site in Europe.\nVery brown it is too. Sure there is a gleaming glass-fronted further education college, a sports centre of dramatic design, a pub and some new homes. But there are also swathes of churned up mud, puddles and scrubby grass.\nThere were ambitious plans for the biggest new town in Europe and an immense shopping centre that would pull in people from all over Scotland. But other retailers didn't like the idea and there was a lengthy court battle that went to the House of Lords.\nBy the time it was over, the recession and the new enthusiasm for shopping online put paid to those dreams.\nEveryone I talk to speaks as if with one mind. If regeneration is to happen it should be well-funded and immediate. But it is not the answer. The answer is \"save our steel\".\nWhat happened to the people of Ravenscraig - what they fear awaits families in Port Talbot - goes to the heart of a problem that haunts the West and reverberates in its politics.\nIt is one part of the reason for the success of Donald Trump in the US and parties of the hard right and hard left in Europe, as well as the plight of the Labour Party in many parts of the UK.\nWhile globalisation may boost the world economy, while its masters feel as at home in Beijing, Birmingham and Berlin, it leaves a remnant floundering in a changing landscape, searching for more secure national identities rooted in a tried and tested past.\nIt explains why we are hearing calls for trade tariffs when once protectionism seemed as old-fashioned as the intense battle over the Corn Laws.\nSteelworks, like coal mining and shipbuilding, were the source of jobs for generations and decent money. But my visit to Ravenscraig reminded me that it was about more than just cash.\nI started my life as a journalist on Teesside in the north east of England at the time when closures were always in the air. It seemed each week the Labour MPs would come up with a new \"dossier of despair\" chronicling decline.\nNot much has changed - Redcar's steelworks finally shut down last autumn.\nLater as an industrial reporter I covered the long and bitter miners' strike.\nThe sector, hit by multiple mass extinctions, not only underpinned a region's economy but was a source of pride and purpose. The sort of feeling that people have for their country or their football team, people had for their industry, their plant, their pit.\nMaybe that's an overly romantic generalisation but there's a truth in it.\nYou don't get that sense of self worth from a call centre or a food court. Nor do you get the power of the unions or a solid commitment to one political party.\nThis is a phenomenon all over Europe and the US. The Rust Belt in the US goes on for mile after mile, rows of corroding chimneys and towers, inspiring Bruce Springsteen's despairing nostalgia for blue collar America.\nYou can see similar discarded husks of heavy industry all over Eastern Europe.\nBut there is a particularly British twist to this story. I remember going to see the heartland of German industry, the Ruhr, six or seven years ago.\nMining is dead but steel is very much alive. Standing high up in a steelworks command centre, like the bridge of a ship, you can look down on an area much bigger than Ravenscraig, pumping out smoke and steam.\nGermany has a strategy that values manufacturing.\nThe SNP government in Scotland would say it does too. When Tata announced the planned closure of the last remaining steelworks, they acted. Details of the deal are sketchy, but it appears the plants were nationalised for a few brief hours and then sold on.\nIt is not just industrial giants Germany and the US who produce more steel than the UK. So do France, Italy and Spain.\nPerhaps, some would argue, that is because they are behind the times. But the question is obvious - if I have been covering the decline of British steel all my working life, what have successive British governments been doing about it?\nAt Ravenscraig you'll hear mutterings about \"Maggie\" and \"the Conservatives\". But it is arguable that all recent governments have seen heavy industry as the past, and banking and services as the bright future - the market embraced with an enthusiasm not matched on the continent.\nThis current steel crisis will pass, one way or another. But it provokes big questions, not only about whether steel is a strategic resource, but about the future of work. That does not mean it will result in a new strategy or new thinking.\nBut this leaves a sense of bitterness in its wake. As one man who worked at the 'Craig for 30 years put it: \"You still need steel. You can't make the Forth Bridge out of plastic.\"",

They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out.\n\"Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit.\"\nThe defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose.\nJohnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union.\nFrance were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end.\nEngland had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra.\nAfter spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most.\nRead more from Tom's blog\nBut it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish.\nWilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag.\nYachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot.\nEngland's players had talked of \"blitzing\" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger.\nAnother line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0.\nEngland were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street.\nLouis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try.\nEngland were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right.\nEngland had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball.\nThey grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7.\nJohnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work.\nFlood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on.\nFrance, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7.\nBanahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved.\nEngland: Foden, Ashton, Tuilagi, Flood, Cueto, Wilkinson, Youngs, Stevens, Thompson, Cole, Deacon, Palmer, Croft, Moody, Easter.\nReplacements: Wigglesworth for Wilkinson (65), Banahan for Youngs (65), Corbisiero for Stevens (49), Hartley for Thompson (56), Shaw for Deacon (49), Lawes for Croft (46), Haskell for Moody (63).\nFrance: Medard, Clerc, Rougerie, Mermoz, Palisson, Parra, Yachvili, Poux, Servat, Mas, Pape, Nallet, Dusautoir, Bonnaire, Harinordoquy.\nReplacements: Marty for Rougerie (68), Trinh-Duc for Yachvili (53), Barcella for Poux (56), Szarzewski for Servat (56), Pierre for Pape (65), Picamoles for Harinordoquy (72).\nNot Used: Heymans.",

Sony, which played a major part in killing off vinyl by developing CDs, has seen them replaced in turn by other music technology such as downloads and streaming, but vinyl is increasingly popular once again.\nThe format has been saved by a resurgence in demand, as it attracts not only nostalgic older consumers, but also younger generations who have rediscovered records, especially in clubs and at music festivals.\nSony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records. Part of the reason for the popularity of vinyl records may be that you can actually sell them in shops. In the UK, record sales brought in more money last year than streaming platforms - although the unit costs of vinyl is many times that of streaming.\nVinyl records have been growing in popularity again in recent years, boosted by events such as Record Store Day in April every year, for which record companies produce special limited-edition singles and albums.\nSony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records.\nIt has not yet said which titles it will be pressing in vinyl, but big sellers in the format these days are a mixture of classic back-catalogue items and modern releases by new bands.",

    "document": "Similar techniques to make simple body parts have already been used in patients, but the kidney is one of the most complicated organs made so far.\nA study, in the journal Nature Medicine, showed the engineered kidneys were less effective than natural ones.\nBut regenerative medicine researchers said the field had huge promise.\nKidneys filter the blood to remove waste and excess water. They are also the most in-demand organ for transplant, with long waiting lists.\nThe researchers' vision is to take an old kidney and strip it of all its old cells to leave a honeycomb-like scaffold. The kidney would then be rebuilt with cells taken from the patient.\nThis would have two major advantages over current organ transplants.\nThe tissue would match the patient, so they would not need a lifetime of drugs to suppress the immune system to prevent rejection.\nIt would also vastly increase the number of organs available for transplant. Most organs which are offered are rejected, but they could be used as templates for new ones.\nResearchers at Massachusetts General Hospital have taken the first steps towards creating usable engineered kidneys.\nThey took a rat kidney and used a detergent to wash away the old cells.\nThe remaining web of proteins, or scaffold, looks just like a kidney, including an intricate network of blood vessels and drainage pipes.\nBy James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News\nGrow-your-own organs might seem like a fantasy, but there are people walking around today with organs made in this way.\nA major breakthrough came in 2006 when bladders made from patients' own cells were implanted.\nGrown windpipes have also been transplanted.\nIn regenerative medicine there are four levels of complexity: flat structures such as skin; tubes such as blood vessels; hollow organs such as the bladder; and solid organs such as the kidney, heart and liver.\nThe last group is the most difficult as they are complex organs containing many types of tissue.\nHowever, there have been early glimmers of success.\nBeating rat hearts have been produced, and grown lungs have been able to keep rats alive, if only for a short time.\nGrowing solid organs is still in its infancy, but these animal studies provide an interesting window on what could be the future of organ transplants.\nWill we ever grow replacement hands?\nThis protein plumbing was used to pump the right cells to the right part of the kidney, where they joined with the scaffold to rebuild the organ.\nIt was kept in a special oven to mimic the conditions in a rat's body for the next 12 days.\nWhen the kidneys were tested in the laboratory, urine production reached 23% of natural ones.\nThe team then tried transplanting an organ into a rat. Once inside the body, the kidney's effectiveness fell to 5%.\nYet the lead researcher, Dr Harald Ott, told the BBC that restoring a small fraction of normal function could be enough: \"If you're on haemodialysis then kidney function of 10% to 15% would already make you independent of haemodialysis. It's not that we have to go all the way.\"\nHe said the potential was huge: \"If you think about the United States alone, there's 100,000 patients currently waiting for kidney transplants and there's only around 18,000 transplants done a year.\n\"I think the potential clinical impact of a successful treatment would be enormous.\"\nThere is a huge amount of further research that would be needed before this is even considered in people.\nThe technique needs to be more efficient so a greater level of kidney function is restored. Researchers also need to prove that the kidney will continue to function for a long time.\nThere will also be challenges with the sheer size of a human kidney. It is harder to get the cells in the right place in a larger organ.\nProf Martin Birchall, a surgeon at University College London, has been involved in windpipe transplants produced from scaffolds.\nHe said: \"It's extremely interesting. It is really impressive.\n\"They've addressed some of the main technical barriers to making it possible to use regenerative medicine to address a really important medical need.\"\nHe said that being able to do this for people needing an organ transplant could revolutionise medicine: \"It's almost the nirvana of regenerative medicine, certainly from a surgical point of view, that you could meet the biggest need for transplant organs in the world - the kidney.\"",

I was intimidated anyway, I felt intimidated by these men,\" she said.\nResponding to Kate's claim, Ms Batmanghelidjh said: \"I would be very concerned if a staff member turned round and said they can't do anything about it.\n\"I'd be very surprised and if a staff member, one staff member, had done that there were lots of others to go to.\"\nKids Company employs 600 paid staff, as well as working with a pool of about 8,000 volunteers and 500 students.\nOne woman who was a paid employee of the charity in 2009 claimed she was the victim of a sexual assault by a co-worker on a night out.\nElla (not her real name) said the man forced his hand into her underwear and had to be pulled away by people around them. She said she reported the incident to the charity, but it was never dealt with properly.\nElla said she was promised the accused co-worker would be kept away from Kids Company until Ms Batmanghelidjh had spoken to him, but the next day he was back on site.\nIn emails seen by the BBC, Camilla Batmanghelidjh wrote to Ella: \"In relation to ******** and the police, that I would support you 100% and that in this situation you were my priority.\"\nHowever, she also questioned the woman's boundaries, writing: \"I'm not excusing *********'s behaviour or saying that your behaviour led to it. I'm merely asking you to be much, much clearer about establishing robust boundaries.\"\nElla said she felt scared that little had been done - and that the man had not been suspended and continued to work at Kids Company.\nElla herself reported the sexual assault allegation to police, but chose not to press charges.\nIn the Newsnight investigation, it heard that male clients of the charity's Urban Academy in their 20s had forced young clients - girls aged 16 to 18 - to have sex with them.\nReferring to one such man, a former employee said: \"There'd be repercussions if they didn't… you have to do it, he'd blackmail them.\"\nShe said the girls were told: \"If you don't do it I'll tell them about this, this, this and this. Or [he would] photograph them naked and then threaten to send it around to other people.\"\nThis employee claims that these allegations had been raised with staff, and she knew of them herself, but said they were not passed on. Newsnight has confirmed that the allegations of coerced sex made by witnesses to the programme were not known to the authorities.\nA week ago, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into Kids Company led by Scotland Yard's child abuse command.\nCamila Batmanghelidjh has emphatically denied any wrongdoing.\nShe told BBC News: \"We've already had lawyers go through the details.\n\"There isn't an allegation that will stand. I'm telling you.  Now.  In 19 years we haven't had a single Child Protection problem in the organisation.   And whenever something is raised with us we immediately report it to the police. \"\nSpeaking to Newsnight later, Ms Batmanghelidjh said the allegations of sexual exploitation by Kids Company clients of other clients were brought to the charity's notice for the first time by police recently.\nShe added: \"If such a thing had taken place on our premises it would have triggered all our safeguarding procedures. I have absolutely no awareness of it.\n\"And there is no awareness of this incident having taken place at Kids Company premises or brought to Kids Company's attention. We would have totally reported something like that.\"",

    "document": "He accused Lord Patten, chairman of the trust which oversees the BBC, of making \"unfair and untrue\" claims not to have known about Mark Byford's payment.\nLord Patten said he \"couldn't have been expected to know\" about the sum.\nMr Thompson told MPs the trust had put him under \"ferocious pressure\" to make senior redundancies like Mr Byford's.\nThe BBC has been criticised for paying £25m ($39m) to 150 outgoing executives - £2m ($3.1m) more than their contracts stipulated.\nMr Thompson -  who is now chief executive of the New York Times newspaper - was one of seven senior BBC figures giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).\nHe was asked about a £949,000 pay-off package given to former deputy director general Mr Byford.\nBy David SillitoArts Correspondent\nA \"grossly unedifying occasion\"  which has damaged the reputation of the BBC - that was Margaret Hodge's verdict. But have we learnt anything?\nMPs seemed to accept Lord Patten's argument that he really could not be expected to have questioned deals such as Mark Byford's £1m pay-off given it was done before he arrived and was said to be within contract. Mark Thompson appeared to convince the committee when he said he had tried to keep the trust informed.\nThe question about why the trust had not done more hung in the air.  The answer that it was not their job did not go down well with some of the MPs. The former chairman Sir Michael Lyons accepted that perhaps they should have taken more of an interest.\nThe government has been watching with interest; the question of how the BBC is governed is being discussed. The debate over the renewal of the charter for the BBC is about to begin and today will only add weight to a growing debate about the future of the trust.\nHe said Mr Byford's redundancy had represented \"value for money\" as part of a wider effort to cut the number of highly-paid executives and save about £19m a year.\nHe said he had believed he had the \"full support\" of the BBC Trust in trying to do that within a very short time frame.\nCommittee chairman Margaret Hodge said under Mr Byford's contract he could have been paid off with £500,000.\nBut Mr Thompson said he was paid almost twice that because the corporation wanted him to be \"fully focused\" on his job in the final months of his tenure and not \"worried about his future and taking calls from head hunters\".\nHe said the fact that he had known Mr Byford for more than three decades and socialised with him did not affect judgement about his severance package.\nAsked by Mrs Hodge if the BBC had \"lost the plot\", Mr Thompson replied: \"I do not think we lost the plot.\"\nBBC HR director Lucy Adams told the committee the corporation was trying to \"get people out of the door\" with minimal disruption and no risk of legal action - and to do that, it was \"occasionally\" necessary to pay more than was contractually required.\nFormer trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons agreed with the MPs that payments like Mr Byford's \"look eye-watering\", adding that \"clearly the trust is damaged\" by the whole affair.\nBut he said the process of making \"rapid reductions in senior management\" was \"very difficult\", adding: \"You think we should have done it for less....\n\"The price of that would have been that it would have taken longer and the savings would have been smaller.\"\nBBC trustee Anthony Fry told the PAC there had been \"months and months of arguments\" between the trust and the BBC executive committee over financial issues such as pay, perks and bonuses - although he admitted that severance packages were not given much attention.\n\"It became a battleground. I got the distinct view... that our views were not being taken with what I believed was the seriousness they deserved,\" he said.\nIn July, Lord Patten told the PAC he was \"shocked and dismayed\" by the scale of pay-offs and said that should Mr Thompson be called before MPs he would be as interested as they were to hear why the trust had not known about them.\nAhead of his appearance before the committee, Mr Thompson sent a letter to the PAC saying he had emails which showed trust members had approved the payments.\nThen, in person, he told the MPs that Lord Patten's claims not to have known about them were \"damaging, unfair and misleading statements\".\nIn reply, Lord Patten said he took the charge of misleading the committee \"very strongly\" and insisted he had been told settlements for Mr Byford and former marketing boss Sharon Baylay were \"contractual payments\" agreed before his appointment.\n\"I'm in the position in which I'm accused of having misled the committee on something I didn't know and couldn't have been expected to know,\" he added.\nTrust director Nicholas Kroll said the deputy director general's severance package was not part of the trust's remit.\nBut Mrs Hodge said the the job of the trust was \"to protect the licence fee payers' interests\", adding: \"There is not one person around the table who can understand why there was no challenge from you.\"\nFormer chairman of the BBC executive board remuneration committee Marcus Agius said there had been \"a great deal of concern\" within his committee \"about these redundancies and the amounts\".\n\"We challenged and tested Mark Thompson and after sustained debate we were finally persuaded on value for money grounds,\" he said.\nMs Adams apologised to the committee for stating in the July hearing that she did not know of an email explaining the pay-offs when in fact, she had helped to compose it.\nThe BBC has recently introduced a £150,000 cap on severance pay.\nMs Adams said she suggested a cap to the executive board before Mr Byford's package was agreed, but it had decided it would be \"inappropriate to introduce the cap at that time\".\nSumming up the hearing, Mrs Hodge said it had been a \"grossly unedifying occasion which can only damage the standing and the reputation of the BBC\".\nShe said the committee believed the governance of the corporation was \"broke\".\nLord Patten told her he accepted there was \"a cultural issue\" around pay at the BBC \"that we really do have to recognise and apologise for and deal with very robustly\" - but that \"trying to get people to face up to lowering salaries and reducing the number of managers is an uphill struggle\".\nHe rejected suggestions that responsibility for governance should be taken from the trust and handed to Ofcom, and said he hoped over the next couple of years the corporation could demonstrate that the existing system could work.\nThe biggest severance payments included:\nThe PAC meeting in July followed the publication of a report in which the National Audit Office criticised the corporation, saying the scale of the payments put public trust at risk.\nA spokesman for the prime minister said earlier that \"legitimate questions\" had been raised about the use of licence payers' money and should be answered.",

Consumers and shoppers need to be on their guard.\n\"Just because it's on sale in one place doesn't mean that's the cheapest place to buy it.\n\"If you look at some of the big brands that have their own stores - even in a sale it's sometimes cheaper to buy those items at a department store or a more general store that sells any number of brands.\"\nJames says \"commitment consistency\" is a key tactic. This is the idea that once you've committed to buy something, you'll buy again.\nWe've long seen merchandise being placed by the till and there are plenty of bargains positioned there today.\nStaff will be encouraging consumers to buy a matching garment, or a warranty to go with what they've already decided to buy, says Clare.\nGuy adds: \"What's really important is to think about what you really want and need in advance.\"\n\"High energy music can create frenzied atmosphere, stimulate the senses and create that sense of having to rush,\" says James.\nGuy says that while the \"smell of mulled wine, Christmas music, and flowers might be nice - it's all part of the sales trick to try to get you to spend.\n\"So try to make rational decision and not an emotional one.\"\nMany stores will bring in extra staff - and this could be the day the Christmas hats come out.\n\"Staff will be on parade tomorrow, we'll see a lot more engagement than usual.\"\nClare says staff \"really have to make this one day count\".\nShe adds: \"There's going to be very little profit margin on heavily discounted products and so they're really going to have to sell like mad to make it worth their while.\"\nIt's all about making a big impact on customers as they walk through the door, and positioning the biggest bargains where they can't possibly be missed.\n\"We're expecting to see big flashy signs and displays at the front of the store, with lighting to draw the eye to them,\" says Clare.\n\"Whether the shopper knows it's Black Friday or not, by the time they've walked through the door, they won't be in any doubt.\"\nRetailers will be targeting customers by email and on their phones too.\nOn last year's Black Friday John Lewis says it saw online sales that were twice as big as their previous record day and sales from mobile devices were three times bigger.\nWith all that in mind, Gillian Guy, chief executive of charity Citizens Advice, share some advice.\n\"Consumer protection laws could give you the right to a refund or repair if you buy something that's faulty, is delivered late or if the product that arrives isn't what you were expecting,\" she says.\n\"Always check the terms and conditions so that if something does go wrong, you know what you can do to get it put right.\n\"If you buy something online, then retailers have to be up front about delivery costs and their returns policy.\"\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube",

Inflation is at 180%, according to official figures, and there are shortages of medicines and basic food items.\nOn Friday, President Maduro declared a state of emergency to \"denounce, neutralise and overcome the external and foreign aggressions against our country\", which he blames for Venezuela's economic problems.\nIn measures published in the government gazette on Monday, the armed forces and local committees will now have powers to distribute and sell food.\nAuthorities will also be allowed to cut the working week in the private sector, as they have done in the public sector, to conserve electricity.\nThe new measures also allow the government to take control of basic goods or services, which analysts say opens the way to the expropriation of companies.\nOn 2 May, opposition politicians handed in 80 boxes containing 1.85 million signatures to the CNE, well above the 1% of voters on the electoral roll needed to kick-start the process.\nOpposition politicians say the authorities are trying to stall the process and have called on their supporters to march to the offices of the CNE on Wednesday to demand they verify the signatures so the process can go ahead.\nThe timing of a potential recall referendum is key because the outcome could be radically different depending on when it is held.\nUnder Venezuela's constitution, if President Maduro were to be removed by a recall referendum in his last two years in office, he would be replaced by his Vice-President, Mr Isturiz.\nBut if Mr Maduro were to be recalled before that, new elections would be triggered.\nThe opposition sees it as essential to have new elections rather than have Mr Isturiz take power, as he is seen as a loyal member of Mr Maduro's Socialist Unity Party.\nFor new elections to be held, the recall referendum would have to go against Mr Maduro before 10 January 2017.",

    "document": "He will make 19 speeches during his tour of Kenya, Uganda and the Central African Republic (CAR) and they will probably address these issues:\nHe is expected to focus on religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence at a time of rising political instability and extremism in much of the region.\nSecurity is expected to be tight throughout the trip, as the faithful flock to see this popular Pope, who has previously said that Christians would be wrong to equate Islam with violence.\nHis first stop, Kenya, has seen some of the worst Islamist violence: Two years ago, gunmen from the Somali militant group al-Shabab massacred at least 67 people inside Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall.\nIn Uganda, his second stop, al-Shabab bombed sports bars in Kampala where fans were watching the 2010 football World Cup on TV.\nMany think the third stop on his trip, the CAR, is too dangerous for him to visit.\nThe Pope's visit to the capital, Bangui, where many have died in violence between largely Muslim Seleka rebels and mainly Christian \"anti-balaka\" militias, is seen as his most dangerous yet - but potentially also one of his most fruitful as a peace-maker.\nIn short: He will probably urge Christians and Muslims to get along.\n2. Poverty\nThis is a Pope who has been hailed as the champion of a church for the poor.\nHis emphasis on the developing world, and the example of simplicity he sets in his own life, will be welcomed in countries where corruption in public life is often seen as an issue.\nHis capacity to look beyond Europe and embrace the concerns of people around the world is also likely to endear him to the faithful, and to those of other faiths, as this Pope from the southern hemisphere offers a message of hope to the dispossessed, and the struggling.\nIn Kenya, 75% of the wealth is owned by around 1% of the population, so Pope Francis's message may well prove popular among many of the remaining 99%.\nHe is likely to criticise inequality and corruption and will visit Kenya's multi-ethnic Kangemi slum - home to around 100,000 people.\nIn short: He will probably criticise corruption and inequality.\nWith international climate change talks starting in Paris on 30 November, many will be listening closely to what Pope Francis has to say when he speaks in Nairobi to the UN's Environment Programme.\nHis encyclical on the environment, \"Laudato Si\" published earlier this year, raised hackles among big business in the US with its apocalyptic warning that humankind risks turning the earth into a \"vast pile of filth\" by mistreating the planet.\nThe Pope is unlikely to mince his words.\nHe will probably emphasise the need for the developed world to stop abusing the planet for profit and to the detriment of the poor, whom he sees as the victims of climate change.\nIn short: He will probably tell big business to think of the poor.\nLGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) activists, especially in Uganda, would like the Pope to encourage greater tolerance and speak out against the criminalisation of homosexuality in many African countries.\nIn the past, when the Pope was asked about a gay priest he said, \"Who am I to judge?\"\nHowever, the recent Synod on the Family in Rome did not budge on the issue of greater acceptance within the Church for gay Catholics.\nMight he directly address the discrimination against gay and lesbian communities on a continent where being gay is often still a crime? Activists certainly hope so.\nThey think it could make an enormous difference to attitudes in the continent.\nAttitudes like that of Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah who told the Synod that what Nazi and Communist ideology were to the 20th Century, so the twin \"beasts\" of \"Western homosexual and abortion ideologies, and Islamic fanaticism\" were for the 21st.\nIn short: He is unlikely to lecture Africa on LGBT rights.\nThe Pope once said that Catholics did not have to breed \"like rabbits\", before the Vatican clarified his remarks to insist that he was not speaking out against large families.\nHowever, many international aid agencies and some Western governments would like the Roman Catholic Church to give up its opposition to artificial contraception, especially its ban on the use of condoms, to help people on a continent where Aids/HIV remains a problem.\nPope Francis is likely to meet people with HIV, but unlikely to budge on contraception.\nLarge Catholic families are helping to ensure that Africa becomes an ever more important part of the Church.\nAnd the Synod on the Family in October reiterated the Church's hostility towards aid programmes that try to link development aid to the use of artificial contraception.\nIn short: He is unlikely to scrap the Catholic ban on contraception.\nFive African countries with the most Catholics:\n1. Democratic Republic of Congo: 31 million\n2. Nigeria: 20 million\n3. Tanzania: 14.2 million\n4. Uganda: 14.1 million\n5. Angola: 10.8 million\nChristianity is projected to be sub-Saharan Africa's largest religious group by 2050 with 1.1bn followers from 517 million in 2010. The Muslim population is expected to grow at faster rate, rising from 248 million to 670 million.\nSource: Pew research centre",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Italian is picking up the fallen champions after a desperate 2015-16 campaign that saw Jose Mourinho sacked just months after winning the title - and also after some undistinguished early performances this season.\nConte is becoming one of the league's most compelling personalities - so how is he mixing pure theatre in his technical area with the job of pointing Chelsea back in the direction that sees them fighting for the big prizes once more?\nConte's touchline antics stand alongside Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp as a visual spectacle, which means the eye can sometimes be drawn to watching the touchline as much as the action.\nAnd Conte was a blur of perpetual motion again on the Stamford Bridge sidelines in the 2-1 win against Spurs on Saturday - but the top coaches never lose control and the Italian knows there is a time and a place to keep a lid on the emotions.\nConte was involved in a long and heated exchange with fourth official Bobby Madley when an apparent handball by Harry Kane was not spotted in the second half. It ended with an outstretched hand of understanding that was graciously reciprocated by Madley.\nHe was also visibly desperate to inject more urgency into Chelsea as they were outplayed by Spurs for 44 minutes until Pedro's equaliser was the catalyst for a complete momentum shift.\nIt was a drama played out with maximum animation as his voice could be heard above the crowd. And the body language - occasionally leaping up and down on the spot - making him look like he was auditioning for Riverdance.\nThere is, however, substance to back up his frenzied technical area style. Conte's half-time messages, bolstered by the equaliser, were clearly received and understood by Chelsea's players as they carried out his instructions to put pressure on Spurs and play at the higher tempo that suits them.\nHe is transmitting his desire to Chelsea's players, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois saying after the Spurs win: \"He's passionate like that every day, every session and that's great for us because it keeps us focused and sharp.\"\nIt has also roused Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea's fans warming to Conte and chanting his name constantly on Saturday night.\nConte's sideshow may be eye-catching but his blood remains cool enough to make the right tactical moves that ensured Chelsea saw out the closing stages of this tight contest in relative comfort.\nConte was keen to stress he wanted his work, and the fact that Chelsea are back on top of the table, to stay low-key and be treated with modesty. \"We must continue to work, improve and we must stay humble,\" said the 47-year-old.\nAnd that is clearly what he intends to do for one of the biggest games of the season when they travel to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City next Saturday lunchtime.\nFor all the emotion on the touchline, Conte is quietly spoken and measured in his press conferences with an increasingly impressive command of English.\nAs Courtois hinted, Conte is obsessive about his work and all the traits he developed in Italy are being brought to bear as Chelsea look unrecognisable from last season.\nConte was known as \"The Hammer\" by some members of the Italian media for the demands on his players, often ringing them at 11pm during his time at Juventus to advise them of changes to training schedules, keeping them on their toes.\nHe even produced a document on players' diet and his exacting standards have not dropped since he took over the office at Chelsea's Cobham training base.\nAs he once said himself: \"There are situations in which you are the hammer and in which you are the anvil. We have to understand the role of the technical staff is of the anvil.\"\nHe also has the miles on the managerial clock to know how to handle every eventuality.\nConte was sacked as coach of Italian Serie B side Arezzo in October 2006, but rehabilitated his career with Bari, Atalanta and Siena before winning three successive Serie A titles with Juventus and taking charge of Italy's national team.\nFormer Italy striker and Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, who was captain when Conte was a player at Juve, told BBC Sport during Euro 2016: \"Football is his life and therefore he wears his heart on his sleeve. He doesn't try to be someone else. After the game he is a very pleasant, quiet guy - but during the 90 minutes he wants to win.\"\nAnd winning is something he is becoming very good at with Chelsea.\nChelsea's dressing room is regarded as one of the most powerful and influential in the Premier League. There have been previous accusations of player power - rejected by those inside the dressing room - but it is \"so far so good\" with Conte.\nAnd a testimony to the harmonising effect he has had can be seen with the presence of John Terry on the substitutes' bench.\nThe 35-year-old has been unable to regain his place since injury and a switch to Conte's favoured three-man defensive system left him on the margins.\nTerry accepts his situation is being shaped by successful results and in conversation with former Chelsea team-mate William Gallas, he praised Conte's straight-talking, honest approach and said: \"If I don't get back in the team it means Chelsea are winning and at the minute we are not conceding goals. It possibly means we are going to win the league and if that's with me or without me that doesn't matter.\"\nConte trusts his players, which is evident from the improvement in forward Pedro and fellow striker Victor Moses after loan spells at Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham. He has flicked the switch with forward Eden Hazard but has decided midfielder Cesc Fabregas is someone he can currently do without.\nAnd what of the warhorse Diego Costa? He is also a beneficiary of Conte's methods.\nHe wanted the infamously combustible striker to keep his cool after a couple of red card near-misses at the start of the season. While Costa will never be a peaceful presence on the pitch he has clearly listened, taking two heavy bangs early on against Spurs but not retaliating in the manner of old.\nCosta certainly knows who is boss after his demand to be substituted during the 3-0 win against Leicester City to avoid a yellow card and possible suspension for the game against Manchester United was studiously ignored.\nOf course all is usually sweetness and light when victories are coming easily, but Conte is determined to do it his way at Chelsea or not at all.\nConte's watershed moment appeared to arrive very early at Stamford Bridge after miserable performances in the 2-1 home defeat to Liverpool and a 3-0 loss at Arsenal in late September.\nAfter that Arsenal defeat, Conte trusted his tactical instincts and reverted to three at the back with David Luiz, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta. He used  Andrea Barzagli, Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci in similar roles for Juventus and Italy.\nThe result? Seven successive Premier League wins and only one goal conceded since the day Chelsea lost at Arsenal and sat in 10th place, eight points behind then-leaders Manchester City, who they now lead by one point going into next week's meeting.\nIronically, since the Arsenal game they have had less percentage possession - 52.79% against 56.88% - than they had in the matches before. Chelsea have also had fewer shots, an average of 16.7 up to the Arsenal game compared with 15.4 after, but they have become a much more efficient machine.\nThe manner in which Liverpool pressed Chelsea into submission, and the way Arsenal cut them open with three first-half goals clearly left Conte with food for thought.\nThe results since have proved Conte is determined to learn the ways of the Premier League and take decisive action. Chelsea's place at the Premier League summit is the reward.",

We haven't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people. The purpose is to try to support disabled people.\"\nHe added: \"The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work, and many are going back to work now, and those who need full support get that full support.\"\nThe government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA).\nUnder the old disability regime, claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance.\nNow, they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment.\nMr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change, and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first, and then 50m.\n\"What we're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments, and those who don't need the higher levels don't take the higher levels,\" Mr Duncan Smith said.\nUnder the DLA system, he said, 70% of people who made a claim got awards \"for life\".\nThe new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants' ailments.\nHe said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expects almost half of the Â£50bn in savings to come in the next 12 months.\nThe raft of welfare reforms, introduced a year ago, also included what the government calls the removal of the \"spare room subsidy\" but critics call the \"bedroom tax\".\nMr Duncan Smith, defending it, said it was not a tax but rather a \"balanced and fair\" policy for taxpayers.\nHowever, Sarah Clifford, director of communications for the Disabilities Trust, said the reforms were part of a \"triple whammy\" of factors affecting disabled people.\nShe said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe housing benefits changes - dubbed the \"bedroom tax\" by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a \"spare room subsidy\" - were introduced in April last year.  A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating \"financial hardship and distress\" for disabled people.\nMs Clifford said: \"We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities.\"\nMeanwhile, the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos, which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work.\nMr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement, saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract.",

    "document": "A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world.\nFor that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks.\nThere have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability.\nThere are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates.\nWith the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.\nCentral banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\".\nOther central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed.\nWhat if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?\nThere are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.\nWith sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.\nIn the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.\nSo if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.\nConversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.\nFurther action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.\nCurrency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.\nInterest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.\nBoth options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.\nFurther quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).\nInterest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%).\nAnother risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.\nThose earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.\nSome observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.\nThe likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.\nThe ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.",

Its ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants the sport's world governing body, the IAAF, to adopt the changes it sets out.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIf the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria:\nThe IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an \"all-time list\", but not be officially recognised as records.\nThis would include Jonathan Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Colin Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon mark of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers.\nMary Keitany of Kenya broke Radcliffe's women's-only world record to win the 2017 London Marathon in two hours 17 minutes one second, the second-fastest time in history.\nThe council also recommended that a performance should be wiped from record books if the athlete had committed a \"doping or integrity violation, even if it does not directly impact the record performance\".\nThe proposals are a response to last year's McLaren report, which uncovered widespread doping in sport - and athletics in particular. Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition unless they can satisfy strict criteria to show they are clean.\nMore than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples.\n\"There are records in which people in the sport, the media and the public do not have complete confidence,\" added taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.\nIAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were \"a step in the right direction\".\n\"There will be athletes, current record holders, who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them, but if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area,\" he said.\nEuropean Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting.\n\"What we are proposing is revolutionary and not just because most world and European records will have to be replaced,\" Hansen added.\n\"We want to raise the standards for recognition to a point where everyone can be confident that everything is fair and above board.\"\nRadcliffe has previously criticised plans to wipe records from the books and last month told BBC Sport she favoured making doping a criminal offence instead to deter cheats.\nShe issued a statement on Monday criticising the new proposals and athletics governing bodies.\n\"I worked extremely hard for my PBs and they will always be valid to me. I know they were set through hard work and best effort and abiding by all the rules and am proud of them,\" Radcliffe wrote.\n\"Governing bodies have a duty to protect every clean athlete, here they again fail those athletes. We had to compete against cheats, they couldn't provide us a level playing field, we lost out on medals, moments and earnings due to cheats, saw our sport dragged through the mud due to cheats and now, thanks to those who cheat we potentially lose our World and Area records.\n\"Although we are moving forward I don't believe we are yet at the point where we have a testing procedure capable of catching every cheat out there, so why reset at this point? Do we really believe a record set in 2015 is totally clean and one in 1995 not?\n\"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity. It is a heavy handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted.\n\"It is confusing to the public at a time when athletics already struggles to market itself.

We know that things will get worse in time. Boys start to lose their mobility, they start to fall over. Quite early on boys are in wheelchairs before they reach their teenage years.\n\"It then starts to affect the rest of their muscles and that particularly includes their respiratory muscles, their heart, the major muscles of the body and that all needs lots of attention, lots of specialist care to look at.\"\nMr Burke said a specialist centre in Wales would give Seth access to all the help he needed, all under one roof.\n\"You get to see respiratory physicians, cardiac physicians,\" he said. \"You get to see experts in neuro-muscular conditions.\"\nMr Burke said Wales should follow the Danish model of treatement, where men were living into their 30s and 40s as opposed to the average life expectancy of 19 to 21 in the UK.\nIn May, Welsh health minister Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh government was working to improve services and support for individuals and their families who are living with muscular dystrophy.\nMs Griffiths said she was committed to ensuring that all patients with conditions such as muscular dystrophy had personal care plans.\nShe added that clinical staff had said further investment should be used for specialist occupational therapists and psychology staff.",

    "document": "Cricket and Nigeria may seem an incongruous pairing, but in Lagos many a weekend players in their colourful kit take to the crease on a dusty pitch in a fiercely competitive cricket league.\n\"This league actually boasts about 99% of the Nigerian national team,\" says Femi Solebo, who chairs the Club Cricket Committee Lagos and also plays for the Ibeju Lekki Cricket Club.\nWatching a game from the welcome shade of the pavilion, he occasionally shouts out instructions to his batsmen taking on Government College Ibadan in a 50-over game.\n\"Over the last three or four years Nigerian cricket has stepped up quite a lot and has allowed these guys here to show their stuff at an international level,\" he says.\n\"Recently the national team got promoted to division five in the World Cricket League, which is a huge achievement for us - we've never been there before in the history of Nigerian cricket.\"\nMr Solebo, who first started playing cricket whilst at school in the UK, reckons that in a population of more than 170 million \"there must be a million or so followers of cricket in Nigeria quite easily\".\nHowever, not many of them are at Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval next to Lagos' dilapidated old racecourse.\nBesides a few team members on the stand and a man barbecuing meat, only a small group watches from deckchairs under a nearby tree, keeping refreshed with drinks from a cool box.\nSome of them turn out to be former Nigerian internationals - stalwarts of the game, some of whom are updating a chat group of enthusiasts with the latest scores by mobile phone.\nFemi Solebo, Club Cricket Committee Lagos chair:\nI joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me\n\"In our time we didn't have as much exposure as the current national team does, we were restricted in playing in just the West African region,\" says Barnaby Ephraim, who now helps administer the game in Lagos.\nHe says it is the Lagos league, which was started more than 15 years ago, that has helped raise the profile of cricket and the opportunity to play it outside school and university.\nIt is also tempering attitudes that see the game as elitist and old fashioned, with some schools - even the established private ones - not seeing the sport as a priority.\nAnd Mr Solebo admits it is difficult to rival football as there are not the fans to warrant tickets that would pay for the upkeep of a turf pitch.\nThe ground the teams use is often rented out by the cash-strapped Nigerian Cricket Federation - and with upcoming elections, political rallies have recently been held here, playing havoc with the pitch, already like concrete after the dry Harmattan season.\nThe game is also expensive for players given the kit needed.\n\"With soccer, all you need is just one ball and then you're away,\" says the 45-year-old.\nBut he says whilst the league is sponsored by private individuals like him with a passion for the game, most of the 400 players in its two divisions are \"from the streets\".\nThe Ibeju Lekki club helps pay for either a player's education or vocational training - and subsidises kit and lunches.\nKunle Adegbola, Nigerian cricket captain:\nCricket is just evolving in Nigeria... in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football\n\"Whatever it is they want to do, we'll fund that and insist that you can only be a member of this club if you have some kind of educational background - and that's what the other clubs try to do as well,\" says Mr Solebo, who runs a company that generates electricity.\n\"I joke with them that if I don't fund them, they're going to come mug me.\n\"Some of them are doing very well in university, some of them have left and are working now.\"\nA few of Lagos' cricketers have even gone professional, like Nigerian cricket captain Kunle Adegbola.\nThe towering 33-year-old has come to practise for his Foundation Cricket Club in the nets ahead of a game the next day.\nWhen the season ends in April in Lagos he will head off to London, where he has played for Burgess Park and Blackheath cricket clubs in the past.\nHe says with more awareness, spectators and sponsorship, he sees great things for Nigerian cricket.\n\"Cricket is just evolving in Nigeria...  in the next four to five years cricket will be out there like football,\" he says.\nBut the Lagosian cricketers know gaining such momentum will only be achieved with serious corporate sponsorship - which would be more likely if ongoing negotiations with a cable TV company bear fruit.\nSo far TV executives have been reluctant to go ahead as they would prefer a national league.\n\"But we say that we can take it in phases, adopt Lagos first and then you can open up,\" says Mr Ephraim, vice-chair of the Lagos State Cricket Association which is also trying to rejuvenate youth interest in cricket.\nHe says that unlike other states there are 35 schools in Lagos now playing cricket - with both boys and girls participating.\nIbeju Lekki player Endurance Ofem agrees junior involvement is key to putting cricket on a football footing.\nBut the former captain of the Nigerian side says offering national team players good welfare packages like those available to professional footballers is important too.\n\"If you do that, every youngster sees the reason to come and play cricket.\"\nFor Mr Solebo, competing with football is not the issue - it is the cricket that matters.\n\"It makes me very proud that our efforts give people joy every weekend - they come here, play with passion and it's fantastic.\"",

A step back on landing may have cost her higher honours.\nRussia's Aliya Mustafina won the gold medal ahead of Beijing 2008 champion He Kexin of China.\nMustafina scored a massive 16.133 to win the title, a mark Tweddle had herself posted in qualifying at London 2012.\n\"Everyone kept saying to me, 'You're a great champ, it doesn't matter what happens today.' I kept trying to tell myself that but I knew if I walked out of here without a medal, I'd have been really disappointed,\" Tweddle told BBC Sport.\n\"I knew the crowd would be good and I got a lot of texts this morning from people saying they were behind me and rooting for me, and that calmed me down.\n\"I know I've done the years of hard work, my coach has too, and she'd have been as gutted as me if we'd come away with nothing.\"\nLondon 2012 marks Tweddle's final outing at this level. She has endured agony to reach this point, her body breaking down in a sport that usually spits out gymnasts by their early twenties at best.\nThe City of Liverpool gymnast slept with an ice machine strapped to her leg for much of this year to calm the swelling from training, and long ago abandoned two of the four pieces of apparatus in women's gymnastics to preserve her fitness for the bars and floor.\n\"This is definitely my last Olympics,\" she confirmed.\n\"It was a tremendous routine by Beth. She went for the big dismount, and knew she had to go for maximum difficulty, and her work on the apparatus was superb. To get a medal is a wonderful moment for Beth and British gymnastics.\"\n\"I'm not totally retiring straight away. It would be too much on my mind and body just to stop.\n\"The federation have said I can keep training a bit, so I can decide what I want to do rather than make drastic decisions.\"\nWhile she did not reach the floor final at her home Games, her bars routine was the best in qualifying and she replicated that scintillating form for nine-tenths of her performance in the final.\nBut two large steps back following her landing were enough to end her challenge for the Olympic title.\nAsked if she might dwell on that moment, Tweddle said: \"Do you know what? I don't care. Coming into London 2012 I had a few different routines. I went with that one; it could have gone totally wrong, and it didn't.\n\"I landed on my feet, I've got a medal around my neck and that's all I'm bothered about.\"\nMustafina, the 2010 all-around world champion, came through a serious knee injury in 2011 to reach London 2012 and was a deserving gold medallist.

Here, Jadhav threatened to pull off something equally astounding:\nOn placid pitches in the the first two ODIs, England made scores of 350-7 and 366-8 only to lose both.\nHere they were more comfortable on a surface that offered movement and bounce for the pace bowlers.\nStill, a weakness of losing wickets at key moments and batsmen failing to convert good starts was repeated.\nJason Roy got into a tangle to be bowled by Ravindra Jadeja for 65, captain Eoin Morgan helped a long hop to short fine leg for 43 and Jonny Bairstow cut to point for 56 - both men victims of the excellent Pandya's 3-49.\nStokes' late hitting took England to a competitive score and their pace bowlers enjoyed the greater assistance to run through the India top order, even after David Willey was forced from the field with a shoulder injury.\nThen came the charge of Jadhav and Pandya, but Stokes and Woakes, who earlier added 73 with the bat in only 40 balls, had the final say.\nSimon Hughes on Test Match Special\nThere wasn't any shame in losing those first two games. There was nothing in it for the England bowlers and they came up against some fantastic Indian batting.\nHere, there was more in the pitch for England and they exploited it very well.\nThe Champions Trophy will have these kind of pitches and England look better suited when the ball does a little bit.\nMan of the match Ben Stokes: \"It was difficult when we came here last time. I put it down to good captaincy to get my overs out of the way before the last over!\n\"It was difficult at the start of my innings. The ball was doing a bit so I gave myself as much time as I could. Woakesy played a good part in that as well.\n\"It has been fantastic to be a part of the series. Thankfully we got a win.\"\nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss: \"We've been playing some good cricket, scoring a lot of runs and we felt we deserved a win.\n\"On this ground, I'm sure there were some memories. It sums up Ben Stokes that he was able to get over it and bowl very well.\"\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan: \"It has been hard work - a competitive series. It was tough for the bowlers. We were rewarded for our persistence and drive to get a result. We fought hard against a really good side.\"\nIndia captain Virat Kohli: \"It's been a series of a lot of positives. We almost got over the line today and we were getting excited to see two of our younger guys showing character lower down the order. I'm very pleased.\"",

    "document": "He said the target to cut net migration to the UK could not be achieved as long as Britain remained a member of the EU.\nLaunching UKIP's campaign poster on immigration, Mr Farage said an \"honest debate\" on the subject was needed to restore public trust in politics.\nThe Conservatives said UKIP's immigration policy was in \"chaos\".\nSpeaking in Dover, Mr Farage told the gathered media that the other parties were making false promises on immigration during the election campaign.\nBut he said the only solution to controlling immigration was to leave the EU - which UKIP campaigns for.\nThe prime minister pledged in 2011 to reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK to levels last seen in the 1990s, about \"tens of thousands\" each year.\nBut the target has not been met, with the latest figures showing net migration rose to 298,000 for the year ending in September 2014 - higher than when he came to office.\nNigel Farage swept in and out of a blustery press call in the shadow of the white cliffs of Dover.\nThe UKIP leader - helped along by a backdrop of party activists - unveiled a poster attacking the Conservatives' record on immigration, in response to which they said UKIP's policy was in \"chaos\".\nAn initially well-behaved press pack soon descended into a gentle scrum, with Mr Farage directed towards one camera then another for a series of interviews.\nHe announced new target immigration figures, was challenged over his views on migrants with long-term illnesses and set an ambitious timeframe to get immigration down.\nThen, time for a coffee - not a pint - in a local pub before Mr Farage was whisked away again.\nA picturesque media opportunity, but one that revealed little more about UKIP's immigration policy other than the obvious fact it is central to their campaign.\nThe symbolic location, with the shadow of France on the horizon, was deliberately chosen by Team UKIP to keep Britain's relationship with the continent at the forefront of people's minds. Although - perhaps ironically - it also caused some mobile phones to switch to French networks in order to function.\nDowning Street said the rise has been driven in part by Britain's economic success relative to its neighbours in the eurozone. Labour said the government's pledge was \"in tatters\".\nBut, unveiling UKIP's campaign advert, Mr Farage said: \"When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest.\n\"Because he knew the truth and I think now the British public, five years on, know the truth: that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain all the while you're members of the European Union.\"\nHe issued a call for a \"return to normality\", saying net immigration - the difference between the number of people leaving the UK and the number coming in - should be brought down to about 30,000 people per year.\nCharlie Elphicke, Conservative candidate in Dover, accused Mr Farage's party of performing U-turns on immigration policy.\n\"All we've seen from UKIP on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay,\" he said.\nI am not sure if it is by design or if he just wants a slow start, but two days in to this general election campaign and UKIP leader Nigel Farage appears to be taking it easy.\nOr at least that is how it seems.\nThis is a candidate who has to win on 7 May. If he fails to become the next MP for South Thanet he has said he will quit as leader.\nYet I have seen no door-knocking. Our cameras have not been told of any public event, yet.\nWe have had two poster-unveiling ceremonies with impromptu leader interviews. He arrives, he speaks, he answers questions, then he leaves.\nRead more from Robin.\nThe EU, and the UK's place within it, is set to be a major issue in the election campaign.\nDavid Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU and put it to a public vote in 2017, if the Conservatives win in May.\nLabour has said it does not support an in/out referendum, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said his party would not \"play footsie\" with the idea of leaving the EU - although he has refused to say he would block a referendum as part of any coalition deal.\nThe Financial Times has reported the Lib Dems would only agree to support a poll if the franchise was extended to EU migrants resident in the UK and 16- and 17-year-olds. The party is also said to want to have a say on the wording of the question and the timing of the vote.\nIn response, UKIP's economic spokesman and campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn accused Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg of preparing to \"rig\" a referendum if they are in power together again.\nHe said it would be \"profoundly unfair\" to allow UK-based EU nationals to participate, and claimed the idea to give younger people a vote was designed to sway the result towards an \"in\" vote.",

    "document": "Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm.\nThe ceasefire was supposed to open the way to aid deliveries in Syria, followed by the rolling out of a co-ordinated military campaign by Moscow and Washington against so-called Islamic State (IS) targets and other groups linked to al-Qaeda.\nIn practice the latest attacks on the aid convoy and hospital seem to have taken things back to square one. Indeed the cynicism of the attack on the convoy in particular is remarkable.\nThe Russians have shown drone footage of their monitoring of the convoy, the route and location of which were pre-announced. But what happened next is disputed.\nThe Americans are hinting strongly that the convoy was attacked from the air by a pair of Sukhoi Su-24 jets - either Russian or Syrian. It makes little difference to Washington, which holds Moscow responsible either way.\nIn contrast, the Russians deny any culpability; they say their aircraft were not in the area and that the destruction of the convoy was the result of action on the ground - the implication is from rebel forces.\nQuite what purpose anyone had in destroying the convoy is unclear, other than to jeopardise the ceasefire. But the seeds of its collapse were there from the outset.\nFirstly, the ceasefire was negotiated not between the warring parties on the ground but by two of their patrons - the US and Russia - who are both engaged in the conflict, in different ways and with very different goals.\nThe Syrian Government and the various rebel factions were not involved.\nSecondly, neither the Russians nor the Americans were able to convince their allies to accept the deal. Moscow had the easier job, to convince the Assad regime, which is hugely dependent upon Russia.\nThe Americans were able to convince some of the rebel groups to back the deal - but many others did not. Indeed many of them have no particular relationship with the Americans.\nFurthermore, the complex and untidy nature of the Syrian battlefield with multiple localised conflicts going on across the country, prosecuted by a variety of actors, made the idea of any ceasefire difficult from the outset.\nThe idea that the guns should fall silent in one war - between the Assad government and a variety of rebel groups - while the US and Russia put their foot on the accelerator in another battle against IS is a little bizarre.\nAny hammering of IS would create local vacuums into which one or other actor, the government or the rebels, might step.\nIn any case many at the Pentagon (and probably one would imagine some inside the Russian Defence Ministry as well) were far from enthusiastic about the proposed joint military campaign against IS.\nIf there was insufficient trust at the outset, then the attack on the aid convoy and the recriminations between Washington and Moscow now, have only made matters worse.\nThe conflict seems to be heading for a brutal stalemate as the fighting continues. The Assad regime is too weak to retake all the areas of the country it has lost. The rebel opposition too weak to seriously challenge it beyond the areas it already holds.\nThe Kurds as well as the Turkish incursion into Syria add an additional level of complexity to the problem. And as mentioned above the continued assault on IS will change the strategic map in Syria whatever happens elsewhere.",

    "document": "In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence\".\nBut the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained.\n\"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said.\n\"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me.\n\"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\"\nSpeaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\"\nThe pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight.\nIt marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West.\nIt is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records.\nMorricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project.\n\"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace.  \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house.\n\"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\"\nThe Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum.\nSet roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive.\nThe score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud.\n\"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past.\n\"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\"\nA sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry.\nDespite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as  The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\".\nThe composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70 million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels.\n\"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says.\n\"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\"\nAnd had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie?\n\"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says.\n\"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry.\n\"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\"\nThe Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January.

    "document": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region.\nFor many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration.\nMr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame.\nA mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught.\nTo use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over.\nBut he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore.\nThe diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma.\nSince 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism.\nDomestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.\nHe was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.\nHis message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia.\nHis concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.\nMeasured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.\nThe much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.\nBut it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.\nThe democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled.\nSince the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.\nWhy West will miss Meles\nObituary: Meles Zenawi\nLife in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi\nA plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.\nFeeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.\nHe orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.\nHis death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.\nThat said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.\nThe opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.\nMr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.\nHe is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.\nHe did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.\nNot in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.\nFrom the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.\nMany embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nThe Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.\nHe swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.\nThe two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.\nHostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.\nIt is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.\nThat would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.\nIn Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.\nThe death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.\nThere are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.\nSuch fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.\nHowever, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.",

Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1.\n\"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds.\n\"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\"\nThe singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear.\nDescribing the concept as \"just hellish\", she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\"\nSo, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland.

It's very special.\"\nHere the diary of Laura's day.\nTour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.\n\"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits.\n\"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.\n\"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\"\nWe arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.\nLaura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\".\n\"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.\n\"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\"\nBackstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.\n\"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura.\n\"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.\n\"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\"\nStill in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts.\nRunning through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano.\n\"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs.\n\"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\"\nTime for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.\n\"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\"\n\"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.\n\"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.\n\"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\"\nMinutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.\nShe's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.\nWith the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.\n\"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura.\nThere's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again.\nLater, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio.\n\"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel.\n\"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\"\nWith all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two.\n\"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \"\nLaura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman.\n\"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\"\nIt's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other.\nUS outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (\"Because he's fine. And obviously amazing\").\n\"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura.\n\"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment.\n\"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\"\nSo what now?\n\"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away.\n\"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out.\n\"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there.

    "document": "\"I know that the presidential campaign is developing actively in France,\" the Russian president said, adding: \"Of course, we do not want to influence events in any way.\"\nThe Russian president appeared to be suppressing a grin as he spoke those words. Marine Le Pen appeared unperturbed.\nShe repeated her support for Moscow's annexation of Crimea, and her opposition to the sanctions subsequently imposed by the EU. If elected to the Elysee Palace, she pledged: \"I would envisage lifting the sanctions quite quickly.\"\nSo the meeting was a win for both. Madame Le Pen looked like a world-leader-in-waiting; Mr Putin received assurances from a woman who might become president of France, and who, like him, opposes the EU and Nato.\nBut there is more to the relationship between Mr Putin and Ms Le Pen than ideological convergence. Because of the National Front's racist and anti-Semitic past, French banks have declined to lend the party money.\nSo Marine Le Pen has been forced to look elsewhere for financing.\nIn 2014, the National Front took Russian loans worth €11m (£9.4m). One of the loans, for €9m, came from a small bank, First Czech Russian Bank, with links to the Kremlin.\nThe loan was brokered by Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, an energy consultant turned MEP, who has called himself \"Mr Mission Impossible\".\nWhen I met him in Strasbourg, he told me he initially secured an agreement with a financial institution in Abu Dhabi, but the deal fell through. He even approached a potential lender in Iran, but Marine Le Pen vetoed the idea, he said. Eventually, he went to Russia.\nThe negotiations over the loan coincided with Russia's annexation of Crimea. EU governments condemned the annexation. Marine Le Pen publicly took the opposite view, leading some to question whether the loans were a quid-pro-quo.\nMr Schaffhauser denied he and Ms Le Pen ever discussed the issue of Crimea in relation to the loan.\n\"Always Marine Le Pen, and Jean-Marie before, was for co-operation with Russia,\" he said. \"It was not a political loan.  It was a commercial loan.\"\nBut Russia did want to use Ms Le Pen to legitimise its actions in Crimea. We know this because a group of Russian hackers, known as Shaltai Boltai, or Humpty Dumpty, published a series of text messages said to be between a Kremlin official and a Russian MP.\nThe exchanges, which took place in mid-March 2014, shows the pair discussing the possibility of Marine Le Pen travelling to Crimea as an observer in the referendum which would lead to Crimea's annexation.\n\"We really need this, I told my boss you were in contact with her,\" the Kremlin official says.\nMarine Le Pen didn't go to Crimea. Instead she publicly backed the results of the referendum, a fact that delighted the Kremlin official and the MP.\n\"She didn't let us down,\" says one text, followed by a smiley-face.\n\"We must find some way of demonstrating our respect to the French,\" comes the reply.\nSome believe the €9m loan, which was made later that year, was indeed a reward for Ms Le Pen's support over Crimea.\n\"For me, there is no doubt that [the loan] was authorised by Kremlin,\" said Mikhail Kasyanov, who was prime minister under Vladimir Putin before he joined the opposition.\n\"[It was] a special operation, a special recommendation of those businesspeople, to help Marine Le Pen.\"\nLong read: The story of Marine Le Pen\nIs Russia really interfering in European states?\nFrance's election: Who are the candidates?\nThe Kremlin told me it had nothing to do with the loans, and that Mr Putin and Marine Le Pen had never met before the visit to Moscow in March 2017. Marine Le Pen echoed that.\nBut I heard something different, and from a pretty good source.\nIn February, I met Marine's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front, at his mansion on the outskirts of Paris. On his desk, he showed me a glossy calendar depicting Vladimir Putin in various military poses.\n\"I see, that's your friend,\" I joked.\n\"He's not my friend,\" he said, \"I've never met him. But he's met Marine.\"\nMr Le Pen was unclear about the exact details of the meeting. But this conversation took place before the public meeting in the Kremlin in March.\nJean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter are not on good terms. She expelled him from the National Front in 2015 in an attempt to distance herself from his racist, anti-Semitic reputation.\nBut other people close to Marine Le Pen also told me that she had claimed to have met Mr Putin previously. Somebody is lying. But who? And why?\nWhen I asked Jean-Luc Schaffhauser about the earlier meeting he said simply:\n\"This is a secret. There are little secrets, and this secret.\"\nMarine Le Pen maintains she has never been influenced by Russian money. But last week it was revealed the National Front had applied for another Russian loan in 2016.\nAmid fears over Russian interference in elections from Europe to the United States, the mystery of her relationship with Vladimir Putin casts a shadow over her campaign.\nMarine Le Pen: Who's Funding France's Far Right? is on BBC One at 20:30, Monday, April 3.

And that was the original purpose of the regulation.\n\"But since then, [the Scottish FA] have brought in a specific regulation that addresses spot and match-fixing, and has much, much heavier sanctions. If we sit in Scottish football as stakeholders and don't do anything, don't address or discuss the issues then I don't think we're doing our jobs.\n\"Because at the moment player after player, perhaps betting on games across Europe, now we've got a chairman and we may have others as well, traipsing up the steps at Hampden to massive negative headlines, and I don't think it's doing our game any good.

We see the problems individuals have that perhaps people in the public don't see, where people have mental health problems, financial problems and addiction issues, which are huge things.\n\"I think we have to get away from the headline-makers - are people breaching the regulations? Yes, they are. That's wrong and if people are breaching a rule, we have to look at the effectiveness of that rule, and the issues around that, and that's where we're trying to take the conversation.\"",

    "document": "President Omar al-Bashir's government likes to keep a tight rein over Sudan's media and cultural institutions, with state-endorsed competitions and publications trying to replace a once-thriving poetry scene.\nA heavy police presence in the capital has discouraged the spontaneous poetic outbursts that were once commonplace on the streets of central Khartoum or the tree-lined pathways of its historic university campus.\nBut in typical Sudanese fashion, coercion has only spurred resistance. Intimate gatherings and online forums have sprung like roses from the concrete.\nNWN is one group that has successfully carved out a space.\nFounded five years ago, the spoken-word poetry event has relied on mailing-list invites and donated venues to escape censorship and police intervention.\nA platform for free expression, where Arabic and English-speaking poets enjoy what my friend Sara Elhassan describes as an open mic that is actually \"open\".\nA luxury in the heavily guarded city, the event has survived raids, threats and scrutiny from National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), which reserves the right to disband public gatherings.\nIt has even resonated around the world when a video of a poetic performance in Arabic and English by Ms Elhassan went viral in 2014.\nThe poem, a response to a Sudanese professor's comment on television that he was unhappy about the unsatisfying levels of beauty exhibited by his country's women, put fresh air into the stale public arena of discussion and expression.\n\"Apparently, we're nothing butâ€¦ pretty faces put on display, to be bought and sold, and later stored as after-thoughts. Pretty faces mounted and hung on the wall like deer heads. Prizes prized, till the novelty dies - then later casually thrown into conversations,\" reads an excerpt from the piece.\nEach time these words were shared on Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter, social commentary, usually monopolised by politicians and academics, was broadened.\nYousra Elbagir:\nSudan's youth now sing along to their own tune to fight censorship and control, with the world as their stage.\nThe performance not only represented a new era of debate but inadvertently paid homage to Sudan's history of oral poetry as a battle cry and assertion of identity.\nIn World War Two, famous poet and praise-singer Aisha Al-Falatiya took to the battlefield to support Sudanese soldiers fighting Axis powers under British rule, motivated by the prospect of independence.\nThe troops were cheered on by her lyrics, which likened the power of fascist leaders Hitler and Mussolini to \"a foreign coin with no value in our market\".\nOnce used to provoke national feeling, poetry is now used by contemporary Sudanese poets to wrestle with a conflicted national identity.\nThe Arabisation campaign under President Bashir has shaped the social landscape, leading popular culture in the East African nation towards the Arab world.\nGrappling with African, Arabic and Islamic identities, many poets like Al-Saddig Al-Raddi turn to the nuances of their own heritage in resistance.\nHis political voice saw him censored and thrown in prison in Sudan. He now lives in London and is considered one of Africa's best contemporary poets.\nAward-winning Sudanese-American poet Safia Elhillo tours the US, inviting audience members to ponder her complex concept of \"home\", weaving images of her grandparent's home in Khartoum with her childhood home in Maryland in both Arabic and English.\nIn 2015, Darfur-born Yale poet Emitihal Mahmoud won the Individual World Poetry Slam with a poem called \"Mama\". A tribute to her mother and striking recount of how she led their escape from their burning village in Sudan.\nSimilar to how olden spoken poetry transformed into folk songs, a whole genre of classic mainstream Sudanese music - known as al-Haqeeba - is rooted in the landmark poems of Wad Al-Rabi, Omar Al-Bana, Khalil Farah and Sayed Abdelaziz.\nSpurred on by revolutions against British colonial powers, Al-Haqeeba took off in the 1920s and was the soundtrack for popular uprisings and cultured resistance in the capital.\nIn what can only be described as a modern renaissance, Haqeeba songs have recently been remixed by young Sudanese producer Sammany.\nThe collection, called Briefcase, has been played more than 250,000 times on Soundcloud.\nIt samples classic songs that borrow lyrics from love poems or poems on national pride.\nThe collection, blends reggae, electro and house beats with Sudanese music in a way that epitomises how many young people in the country feel: connected to their nation's rich culture but also mainstream global trends, sounds and tastes.\nJust as its soldiers historically marched to lyrics of resistance, empowerment and heritage against foreign ruling powers, Sudan's youth now sing along to their own tune to fight censorship and control, with the world as their stage.",

Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused.\n\"The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others.\"\nThe Finucanes did not co-operate with the review and the solicitor's widow said the de Silva report did not tell her much more than she previously knew about the case.\nHer son, Michael, claimed the government had refused their demand for a full inquiry because it did not want people to be questioned in public.\n• There were extensive \"leaks\" of security force information to the UDA and other loyalist paramilitary groups.\n• There was a failure by the authorities to act on threat intelligence.\n• Employees of the State and State agents played \"key roles\" in the murder.\n• There was a failure to investigate and arrest key members of the West Belfast UDA over a long period of time.\n• There was a wider \"relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice\" after the murder had taken place.\nSir Desmond found that \"senior Army officers deliberately lied to criminal investigators\" and that RUC Special Branch \"were responsible for seriously obstructing the investigation\".\nThe report concluded that Nelson did not provide his handlers with details of the plot against Mr Finucane.\nIt found that MI5 received intelligence two months before the killing that Mr Finucane was under threat but that no steps were taken to protect him.\nIt also found that MI5 helped spread propaganda against Mr Finucane in the years before he was killed.\nSir Desmond found that \"in 1985 the security service assessed that 85% of the UDA's 'intelligence' originated from sources within the security forces\".\nAnd he was \"satisfied that this proportion would have remained largely unchanged\" by the time of Mr Finucane's murder.\"\nSir Desmond de Silva QC carried out the review at the government's request. The Finucanes want a public inquiry as they feared the full truth would not emerge.\nIn his report Sir Desmond said: \"A series of positive actions by employees of the state actively furthered and facilitated his murder and that, in the aftermath of the murder, there was a relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice.\n\"My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucane's case has left me in no doubt that agents of the state were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder.\n\"However, despite the different strands of involvement by elements of the state, I am satisfied that they were not linked to an over-arching state conspiracy to murder Patrick Finucane.\"\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Cameron was strongly critical of the RUC and Army for their conduct in relation to the killing.\nHe said Sir Desmond concluded that there was \"no political conspiracy\" over the murder but that \"ministers were misled\".\nMr Cameron added that the report found \"no evidence whatsoever that any government minister had fore-knowledge of Mr Finucane's murder\".\nHe said that on behalf of the government and the whole country he wanted to say to the Finucane family that he was \"deeply sorry\".\nLast year, Mr Cameron acknowledged there was state collusion in Mr Finucane's murder and apologised to his family.\nIn the report, Sir Desmond found that an account one of the murderers, Ken Barrett, gave to the BBC Panorama programme about receiving intelligence from the RUC was \"essentially accurate\".\nHowever, he added that some specific allegations made by Barrett against individual officers were not reliable.\nFormer Ulster Unionist MP Lord Maginnis of Drumglass said the apology was \"ridiculous\".\n\"The reality is that the Finucane family were an IRA family and I can illustrate that by saying that, when I gave that allegation publicly and was being sued for libel, the family retracted and paid my legal expenses,\" he told the House of Lords.\n\"So let's not fool ourselves about the godfather Finucane, who was killed.\"",

    "document": "Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger.\nMission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet.\nSuch worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life.\nNasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home.\nIt is around 1,400 light years away from Earth.\nJon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\"\nThe new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth.\nDetermining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own.\nKepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's.\nThe mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet.\nThe new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.\nTwelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star.\nThis zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met.\nOf these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet.\nDr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date.\n\"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.\n\"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\"\nWhile similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth.\n\"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.\n\"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\"\n\"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\"\nDr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.\n\"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make.\n\"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\"\nDr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii.\n\"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\"\nHe added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.\n\"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\"\nThe findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",

Under its agreement with EDF, it will also have a stake in a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.\nThe Chinese will then be allowed to develop their own reactor technology at Bradwell in Essex, subject to planning and regulatory approvals.\nThe government is now expected to publish some of the key documents linked to the deal. These will include the Contract for Difference and the waste transfer agreement that covers nuclear waste generated by the plant.\nAfter numerous delays, EDF's board agreed to proceed with the controversial project back in July.\nBut just weeks after taking office, Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a review of the deal, leading to questions over the UK's openness to foreign investment.\nHer government gave its approval two weeks ago on condition that it could prevent EDF from selling its controlling stake before completion of the project.\nEDF's board approved the new terms on Tuesday, paving the way for the formal signing of the deal.\nYou can follow John on Twitter at @JohnMoylanBBC",

In future, if you stay with the News at Ten until the end of the weather, you will have missed the first 13 minutes of the programme.\nAnd finally, for fans of the red chair and the celebrity sofa, this is a Monday to Thursday-only change.

If we don't get it right, we could be simply storing up problems for the future, providing rich and fertile grounds for those who seek out grudge and grievance as a way of life.\"\nScottish Finance Secretary John Swinney held talks with his UK government counterparts in London on Friday.\nMr Swinney said afterwards that progress had been made, but some \"significant issues\" still remained before a final deal could be agreed.\nThe two government have been locked in protracted discussions about how the block grant that Holyrood receives should be adjusted when new tax powers are devolved to Scotland.\nAny deal must meet the principle of \"no detriment\" - the idea that neither the UK or Scottish governments should lose out financially simply as a result of the decision to devolve.\nMr Swinney and Scottish Secretary David Mundell are both due to appear before the Scottish Parliament's Devolution Committee on Tuesday, where they will be asked to lay out their positions.\nWith the Scottish Parliament being dissolved next month ahead of May's elections, MSPs on the committee had warned of \"very substantial impacts\" on their ability to scrutinise any proposals if talks were not concluded by 19 February.\nBut Chief Secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands has said he will not be able to appear before Holyrood's Finance Committee on Wednesday to give evidence to MSPs about the talks.\nMr Hands, who has been negotiating on behalf of the UK government during the talks, had previously said he would be \"very happy\" to appear before MSPs once a deal had been reached.\nIn a letter to the committee, he said: \"I fully intend to honour that commitment. Unfortunately, due to parliamentary business I can not attend your committee on 24 February.\n\"I look forward to appearing before your committee once the framework is agreed.\"\nIn response, committee convenor Kenneth Gibson told Mr Hands: \"This would appear to suggest that you do not think an agreement will be reached on the fiscal framework before then.\"\nHe urged Mr Hands to reconsider, stating: \"If this is indeed the case, then it is essential that the Finance Committee has the opportunity to hear from both governments as to why it has not been possible to reach an agreement.\"\nThe Scottish government has already warned it will pull the plug on the Scotland Bill by recommending MSPs veto the legislation if an agreement over the fiscal framework cannot be found.",

It has since heard from about 800 \"unhappy\" customers and has \"demanded companies answer questions about how they operate, and closely examined the play on a range of websites\".\nAs a result it has identified \"a number of operators engaging in practices likely to be breaking consumer law\", which is why it is taking enforcement action.\nThe controversial promotions involve terms and conditions which prevent punters from walking away from play with their winnings at a point of their choosing.\nFor example, someone might bet £10 of their own money which is then matched by £10 from the online betting company.\nHowever, in the terms and conditions of play it might state that the customer has to play several hundred times within a certain period of time before they can cash in their winnings.\nIn some instances, under these \"wagering requirements\" people have amassed winnings of several thousand pounds but they have had to keep on betting, said the CMA, meaning that their chances of losing money increase.\n\"They don't have the choice to quit while they're ahead and walk away with their winnings when they want to,\" the CMA said.\nThe Remote Gambling Association (RGA), whose members include many online gambling firms, said it would take \"some time to digest and consider properly\" the CMA announcement.\n\"However, where failings are identified companies individually will rectify them,\" it added.\n\"If there are generic lessons to be learned then, as ever, we will work with the Gambling Commission to bring those to the attention of the wider industry with a view to raising standards across the board.\"\nInitially the CMA is talking to the companies involved, which it says it cannot name, demanding that they change their practices.\nIf they do not meet the requirements, the CMA can take them to court. The court could fine the companies or ultimately revoke their licences.\nThe Gambling Commission has been working alongside the CMA on the investigation.\nIt said identity checks were an \"important duty\" for the gambling industry to \"prevent money laundering and to ensure responsible gambling\".\nBut, it added, concerns had been raised that some operators might be \"applying these requirements in a restrictive way, preventing consumers from legitimately withdrawing funds from their gambling accounts\".\nThe online gambling sector has grown by about 150% since 2009 and is worth £4.5bn. The CMA said more than 6.5 million people regularly use the sites.\nThe CMA's George Lusty led the investigation. \"If you're required to place hundreds of thousands of bets before you can make a withdrawal, then that is going to require you to invest a lot of time into these promotions,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Our main interest is these casino-type products, but we do also have some concerns in relation to free sports bets promotions as well.\"\nThe CMA is also asking for other people who have had trouble withdrawing their money to come forward by 31 August to help it \"probe this issue even further\".\nChris Sattin from Gloucester was playing roulette on a website called Maria Casino and won £35,000, but he wasn't allowed to withdraw his winnings.\nHe told Radio 4's You and Yours: \"I was shaking, my adrenaline was pumping. I pressed on the iPhone to withdraw, but nothing was happening. Because I'd never won these sums of money before, I thought maybe it's only happening because it's a large sum of money and I need to contact customer services.\"\nMaria Casino told Chris he had an account with its sister company Unibet, and he had used a self-exclusion feature on the site - something introduced by the Gambling Commission to help problem gamblers.\nChris told the company he had self-excluded only to close his account. But Maria Casino said this breached the company's terms and conditions.\nYou and Yours contacted Maria Casino about Chris's case and they decided to pay him the £35,000 winnings.",

    "document": "In articulating why the tournament needed a dramatic overhaul, Dodson spoke about \"bleak prospects\" and \"perfect storms\" if everything stayed the same. Browne went even further when pointing out a \"potentially profound\" risk to the professional game in Ireland if the Pro12 didn't get its act together.\nIt was all about money. The Pro12 brings in about £12m in television revenues - a relative spit in a bucket compared to the riches of the Premiership in England and the Top 14 in France.\nThe unions in Scotland, Ireland and Wales were all beside themselves with worry over the yawning financial disadvantage they were at compared to the English and the French as they attempted to keep hold of their marquee players.\nIn exploring the possibility of inviting two American franchises into the Pro12 in time for the 2018-19 season, Dodson spoke of the necessity to tap into new markets and find new money in order to fight off English and French clubs who may come looking for Scotland's finest. \"To stay as we are is not an option,\" he said.\nThings have changed. It's not the Americans who are in the frame now, it's the South Africans. And 2018-19 is not on the table anymore, it's 2017-18. It's the coming season, which begins in September.\nOn 7 July - this coming Friday - the South African Rugby Union will go through the Pro12's list of requirements for acceptance of two of their franchises - the Cheetahs from Bloemfontein and the Kings from Port Elizabeth - into the next Pro12 campaign.\nThey will have to make commitments on finance - each of the current 12 clubs from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales could be in line for an extra £500,000-£800,000 in revenues from the South African union and South African television - as well as commitments on squad enhancement. The last thing the Pro12 needs is two more also-rans.\nThe Cheetahs and the Kings are the poor relations of South African rugby. Of the six SARU franchises in Super Rugby, they are the weakest. They sit in their usual perch at the tail-end of the southern hemisphere club competition, a combined eight wins from 27 games this season and six wins from 30 games last season. Of the 27 players used by the Springboks in their 3-0 series win over the French this month, only two came from the Cheetahs and none at all from the Kings.\nSuper Rugby is a failing competition, the expansion to 18 teams - to include sides from Japan and Argentina in addition to those from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - has proved to be a calamity that now needs unravelling. The crowds are falling, the television audience is collapsing, there are too many teams in a bloated league format that is confusing and unloved.\nThree teams will be culled at the end of the current season - the Cheetahs and the Kings are two of them. SARU could have killed off the pair of them or they could have rolled them into their four other franchises, but then the Pro12 option struck and now, according to sources close to the negotiations, this deal is 75% likely to happen in time for the coming season.\nAlready, behind the scenes, a provisional format for a new Pro14 is being put together. There are different scenarios but the most probable is that the 14 teams are split into two divisions of seven - two Irish, two Welsh, one Scottish, one Italian and one South African.\nThey'd play home and away - 12 games. All the regular local derbies would exist on top of that. Instead of two rounds of the 1872 Cup between Glasgow and Edinburgh there would be three. Play-offs would continue and fewer games would be played in international windows.\nThat's if SARU deliver the goods on Friday and everything goes smoothly thereafter. Don't discount a spanner in the works, but there is mounting confidence in this going through.\nIf it does, then the already rapid pace of change will go up another gear as the various unions attempt to sell this to their supporters, and their various commercial and logistical arms attempt to put plans in place. There's a fixture schedule to be organised, there are arrangements to be made over playing the South Africans in South Africa and having the South Africans playing in Europe.\nThe Pro12 already has too many uncompetitive teams and one of the pre-requisites of the deal would be that the decidedly underwhelming Cheetahs - who average just less than 8,000 fans per home game in a stadium that holds 48,000 - and the flops that are the Kings - who bring in just 7,000 per game in a ground that holds almost 49,000 - would be beefed-up by transplanted Springboks.\nQuite how SARU are going to remove talents from the Stormers, the Bulls, the Sharks and the Lions without there being an uprising in Cape Town, Pretoria, Durban and Johannesburg is anybody's guess. That's what they will need to sign up to, though. There's potentially a mountainous in-tray and precious little time to get through it. If Friday happens the way Pro12 officials think it may, they'd have eight weeks until the new league is supposed to start.\nThere is a surreal air to all of this. Supporters of the Pro12 clubs haven't really engaged with this story yet, partly, one suspects, because the British and Irish Lions are preoccupying their thoughts and, partly again, because they probably think this is just a flyer, a silly season story for the summer, a bottle of smoke.\nIt's hard to get your head around. The wrong kind of expansionism - plans are still afoot to bring in an American franchise next summer - has brought Super Rugby to a dark place. Why follow them?\nHow can you shoe-horn in, at eye-watering speed, two disparate South African franchises and expect to be taken seriously as a league? How can supporters buy into a competition that looks like a dog's dinner? The Pro12 knows that in terms of PR they have an Everest to climb. In their slippers. Going backwards. In a blindfold.\nThere's also the bottom line that Dodson and Browne and others have spoken about. As it is, the Pro12 is not doing it for them as a commercial entity. To sit on their hands and do nothing but moan about their lack of cash and their vulnerability to rich owners in England and France achieves nothing.\nThe Pro12 needs a radical shake-up, it's true. This would be radical, no doubt about it. A year ago, Dodson and Browne said they wouldn't be hanging about, that the time for action was now. Usually you take that stuff with a pinch of salt. For some, as they digest this, it'll be a shot of brandy that'll be required.",

He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption.\nProsecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared.\nMr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases.\nFrench Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him.\nIn a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of \"aggravated pimping\" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes.\nMr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when she was finance minister.

We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union.\"\nLabour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a \"meaningful vote\" on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe.\nShadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as \"red lines\".\nMs Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was \"illogical\" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected.\n\"There will need to be back channels, private conversations.

If anything, they've been better than they were last season. With Rangers in the league, with a stronger Hearts team, they've still been the second-top team in Scotland and I think Derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Even if Rangers were to win (on Sunday), I don't think they will finish second. Aberdeen have been so consistent, especially at home, so I fully expect Rangers to lose.\"\nThe Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch.\nThey may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April.\n\"Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side,\" Thompson added. \"Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do.\n\"The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal. I just think there aren't enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he's done.\"\nMeanwhile, former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss, Pedro Caixinha.\nThe Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday's goalless draw with Kilmarnock, and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"For me, it's nonsensical to give the opposition your team,\" Thompson said. \"It gives them extra time to prepare, and insight into how they're going to go about beating your side.\n\"I've never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines, let alone a day before like he did. I found that puzzling.\n\"Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team. I think he's trying to show he's done his homework, but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn't change too often.\n\"If I was Derek McInnes, what would I think of that? Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me.\"\nThompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton.\nThe 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock.\n\"It's far too early to be making judgements,\" Thompson asserted. \"None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.\n\"One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.\n\"Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well. It won't happen this season, but if he continues to take risks like he does and he isn't getting results next season, it won't be long before he receives criticism.\"",
